0008_00.01.03.900-00.01.06.120	He wants to kill Gamora because Ronan killed his family.
0008_00.01.06.120-00.01.08.780	But Quill convinces him to work with them and kill Ronan together.
0008_00.01.08.780-00.01.15.510	And since Gamora plans to sell the Orb for 4 billion units, Rocket decides to help them too for a share of that, rather than cash in on Quill's bounty.
0008_00.01.15.510-00.01.16.710	"I am still Groot."
0008_00.01.16.710-00.01.23.350	Back at Ronan's crib, Ronan finds out that Gamora is going to betray him and gets torn a new one by Thanos for alienating his favorite daughter, Gamora.

0008_00.02.05.950-00.02.09.550	At the same time, it seems Yondu managed to track Quill down as well; what a nightmare.

0008_00.02.27.900-00.02.31.060	Nebula's like, "Yeah, and I'll help too!  I hate you, Dad!"
0008_00.02.31.060-00.02.34.970	Back with the Ravagers, Quill get slapped around a little before convincing Yondu to let them go.
0008_00.02.34.980-00.02.39.010	He says if they use Gamora's inside knowledge and all work together, they can retrieve the stone, and Yondu can have it.
0008_00.02.39.010-00.02.44.420	So Rocket, Drax, and Groot jump aboard the ship as well, and after a few arguments, they have a montage and come up with a plan to take down Ronan.

0008_00.02.57.360-00.02.59.110	The guys confront him, but he's just too powerful.
0008_00.02.59.110-00.03.02.670	He's about to kill Drax, but then Rocket flies through the window and just wrecks the whole ship.
0008_00.03.02.670-00.03.07.390	So the heroes are now hurtling towards the ground, but Groot uses some tree magic to surround them with this wooden cocoon.
0008_00.03.07.400-00.03.10.860	Rocket has tears streaming down his face and he's like, "No, Groot!  This will kill you!"
0008_00.03.10.860-00.03.13.180	Groot replies, "We are Groot."
0008_00.03.13.190-00.03.14.740	The ship crashes and the guys come to.
0008_00.03.14.740-00.03.16.460	Unfortunately, Ronan also survived.
0008_00.03.16.480-00.03.21.180	But out of nowhere, Quill just starts singing and dancing to distract him, allowing Drax to blast the Stone out of his hammer.

0019_00.01.07.320-00.01.13.160	Doc is a scientist who is always working on some crazy and wacky experiment and Marty seems to help out when he can.
0019_00.01.13.160-00.01.21.070	Marty ends up later meeting Doc in a parking lot where Doc shows Marty the DeLorean that he's converted into a time machine.
0019_00.01.21.070-00.01.27.720	The DeLorean utilizes a flux capacitor which is powered by plutonium which Doc stole from a group of Libyan terrorists.
0019_00.01.27.720-00.01.32.590	While running some initial tests on the vehicle, however, the Libyan terrorists show up and gun down Doc.
0019_00.01.32.600-00.01.44.190	Marty jumps into the DeLorean to avoid getting shot himself, getting up to the famous 88 miles per hour, and gets sent back in time to November fifth, 1955.
0019_00.01.44.210-00.01.50.970	Now in the year nineteen fifty-five, Marty runs into a young George McFly, who is being bullied by a young Biff Tannen.
0019_00.01.50.980-00.01.59.180	After Marty saves George from Biff, Marty has to save George again from being hit by a car, which ends up knocking out Marty instead.
0019_00.01.59.190-00.02.09.590	Marty begins to wake up and finds himself in a bedroom and begins talking about how he had a strange dream of being sent back into the past, thinking he is being comforted by his 1985 mother.
0019_00.02.09.600-00.02.18.220	Instead, however, he is actually being comforted by his 1955 mother, Lorraine, who is about the same age as him and is somewhat aggressively flirting with him.
0019_00.02.18.230-00.02.29.190	Marty is mortified, not only by the fact that he is being hit on by a younger version of his Mom, but he also realizes that he's ruined the opportunity where his Father originally met his Mother.
0019_00.02.29.190-00.02.37.180	Marty eventually finds the 1955 version of Doc Brown and Marty convinces him that he is actually from the year nineteen eighty-five.
0019_00.02.37.190-00.02.44.680	Marty expresses that he needs more plutonium so he can go back to his original time.
0019_00.02.44.690-00.02.52.570	However, Doc explains that getting plutonium is not a very easy task and they decide to use the famous historical lightning strike that will hit the clock tower later this week.
0019_00.02.52.580-00.03.04.600	They will use the one point twenty one gigawatts of power that comes from the lightning in order to allow the DeLorean to travel back to the year nineteen eighty-five.
0019_00.03.04.630-00.03.11.890	Marty realizes that after looking at a photo though that him and his siblings are beginning to fade out of the picture because his parents had never met the way they were supposed to, causing them to never fall in love, and Marty to never be born.
0019_00.03.11.900-00.03.25.910	So Marty begins to work on a plan to get his parents back together so that he can be born and the events of the film can still take place and not cause a paradox.
0019_00.03.25.920-00.03.29.420	Through a series of events, Marty ends up taking Lorraine, his mother, to a school dance.
0019_00.03.29.440-00.03.36.900	Marty's plan was to force himself on his mother, causing her to be offended and for George to come in and save the day.
0019_00.03.36.900-00.03.42.240	However, Biff shows up and Biff instead tries to force himself on Lorraine.
0019_00.03.42.260-00.03.48.650	George punches Biff, knocking him down, and Lorraine ends up going with George to the dance floor, where they have their first kiss.
0019_00.03.48.650-00.03.55.930	There is then a scene where Marty plays the guitar on the dance floor and really that doesn't have much to do with the story, but it's a relatively iconic scene.
0019_00.03.55.930-00.03.59.220	After leaving the dance, Marty returns to the clock tower where the lightning is supposed to hit.
0019_00.03.59.230-00.04.04.810	Doc has everything set up and Marty tries to give Doc a letter warning him about the Libyan terrorists.
0019_00.04.04.820-00.04.09.440	Doc rips up the letter out of fear that the knnowledge will result in catastrophic outcomes.
0019_00.04.09.440-00.04.10.020	UNMATCHED:  Marty decides that he would go back ten minutes earlier in the year nineteen eighty-five then he initially left, in order to warn Doc then.
0019_00.04.10.030-00.04.26.080	Marty then gets into the DeLorean, gets up to 88 miles per hour, and travels back to nineteen eighty-five, where he hurries from the parking lot to try to save Doc.
0019_00.04.26.110-00.04.36.200	Unfortunately, however, Marty is too late and Doc is still shot and he sees the other version of Marty take off in the other DeLorean to go back to nineteen fifty-five.
0019_00.04.36.210-00.04.46.050	Initially, Marty runs down to Doc to be with him during his last moments and it turns out Doc was actually wearing a bulletproof vest and he had actually taped up the letter that Marty had given him.
0019_00.04.46.050-00.04.53.190	Doc takes Marty back home and then Doc takes off for the year 2015 to see what the future has in store.
0019_00.04.53.200-00.04.56.760	The next morning, Marty finds that his family has drastically changed.
0019_00.04.56.770-00.05.08.590	They seem wealthier, his father, George, is a more confident man, his mom, Lorraine is fit and in shape, and even Biff, who in the beginning of the film was George's superior, is almost now a servant to the McFlys.
0019_00.05.08.600-00.05.23.590	Marty meets up with his girlfriend, Jennifer, only to be interrupted by Doc, who is wearing strange and new clothing and insists that they both must get into the car, stating that there is a problem with Marty and Jennifer's kids.

0020_00.00.12.645-00.00.16.795	Today we are going to be looking at part two of The Back to the Future series.
0020_00.00.16.795-00.00.17.415	So let's get started.
0020_00.00.17.420-00.00.28.090	The film begins the same way the previous one ended, with Doc picking up Marty and Jennifer, taking them to the future in order to prevent their future son, Marty Jr., from participating in a robbery.
0020_00.00.28.090-00.00.36.780	They arrive in the future on October 21st, 2015.
0020_00.00.36.780-00.00.38.160	UNMATCHED: This is the actual date that they arrive, not all those crazy Photoshop dates that always appear on Facebook.
0020_00.00.38.160-00.00.48.240	When they arrive, Doc uses a device to make Jennifer sleep and Marty goes into town to pose as his son so he can refuse to participate in the robbery.
0020_00.00.48.240-00.00.57.010	While in the diner, Biff's grandson, Griff, (Remember Biff was the antagonist from the first film) enters to try to coerce who he thinks is Marty Jr. to help in the robbery.
0020_00.00.57.020-00.01.04.860	Marty refuses the offer and a big fight breaks out but eventually Marty wins and Griff and his friends are arrested.
0020_00.01.04.860-00.01.17.030	Before meeting back up with Doc though, Marty buys a sports Almanac, which shows all the winners of the major sporting events from 1950 to the year 2000, so several games that Marty still has not seen.
0020_00.01.17.040-00.01.23.710	Doc finds the Almanac, scolds Marty, telling him the serious issues that could arise from using this knowledge.
0020_00.01.23.710-00.01.30.390	Doc and Marty then both discover that the unconscious Jennifer was taken to her 2015 home and they need to go get her.
0020_00.01.30.390-00.01.35.360	While all this is going on, the much older Biff has been listening the entire time.
0020_00.01.35.370-00.01.50.140	While Marty and Doc are preoccupied with rescuing Jennifer from her future home, Biff steals both the DeLorean and the Almanac, goes back to the year nineteen fifty-five, in order to give the sports Almanac to a younger version of himself to make himself rich through betting.
0020_00.01.50.140-00.01.55.690	Biff then returns the DeLorean to the year 2015 with Doc and Marty unaware anything has happened.
0020_00.01.55.690-00.02.06.790	Doc and Marty, along with a still unconscious Jennifer, go back to nineteen eighty-five, only to find out that the town has drastically changed.
0020_00.02.06.790-00.02.11.530	Biff is now a very wealthy and corrupt man who has turned Hill Valley into a near apocalyptic society.
0020_00.02.11.530-00.02.18.860	Biff killed Marty's father and has forced Marty's mother, Lorraine, to marry him and Doc in this timeline has been committed to an insane asylum.
0020_00.02.18.860-00.02.31.480	After Marty discovers that Biff did use the Almanac and discovers what date he got the Almanac on, Marty rushes back to November 12, 1955 to prevent Biff from ever getting the Almanac.
0020_00.02.31.480-00.02.36.350	Marty sees Biff get the Almanac and follows Biff to the high school dance from the first film.
0020_00.02.36.350-00.02.48.340	A big chase eventually ensues and Marty gets the Almanac and destroys it, however, while destroying the Almanac, the DeLorean which Doc is sitting in it struck by lightning, sending it back in time.
0020_00.02.48.340-00.02.57.430	Then, out of nowhere, a Western Union courier appears handing Marty a letter, that was from Doc, stating that he had been sent back to the year 1885.
0020_00.02.57.430-00.03.01.770	Marty then runs back into town to find the 1955 version of Doc.
0020_00.03.01.790-00.03.23.290	The 1955 Doc had just sent an earlier version of Marty from the first film away and upon seeing the new version of Marty appear, this causes him to faint and ends the film.

0021_00.00.09.880-00.00.12.860	Hello everyone, and thanks for watching movie spoiler alerts.
0021_00.00.12.870-00.00.17.600	We're going to be spoiling Back to the Future Part 3, the final installment of the series.
0021_00.00.17.600-00.00.23.990	The movie opens where the previous film left off, with Marty being in the year nineteen fifty-five, having just discovered that Doc is stuck in the year 1885.

0021_00.00.35.290-00.00.49.970	While doing so, they discover Doc's tombstone from 1885, stating that he died six days after he wrote the letter to Marty, being killed by Buford Mad Dog Tannen.
0021_00.00.49.970-00.00.53.750	Note this is Biff's great-grandfather.
0021_00.00.53.750-00.00.54.280	UNMATCHED: Doc's tombstone states that he was killed over a matter of eighty dollars. 
0021_00.00.54.280-00.00.54.850	UNMATCHED:  I know this part is a bit confusing, but I'll do my best to keep it clear. 
0021_00.00.54.850-00.01.01.910	UNMATCHED
0021_00.01.01.920-00.01.08.340	Just to go over it again, the 1985 Doc was sent back to the year 1885 where the DeLorean was damaged, trapping him there.
0021_00.01.08.340-00.01.09.730	UNMATCHED: Doc in the year 1885 writes Marty a letter and has it post-dated to arrive at a very specific time and place in the year nineteen fifty-five.
0021_00.01.09.740-00.01.24.830	Marty receives the letter and after finding out that Doc is trapped and the location of the DeLorean, which Marty can use to time travel himself.
0021_00.01.24.830-00.01.35.830	Marty goes to find the 1955 version of Doc, which remember is 30 years younger than the Doc who got sent back to 1885.
0021_00.01.35.830-00.01.46.450	The younger Doc and Marty work together to repair the DeLorean and that's when they discovered that the older Doc, the one who was sent to the year 1885, was murdered just a few days later.
0021_00.01.46.450-00.01.57.540	So Marty takes the repaired DeLorean back to the year 1885 to intervene with the older Doc's murder.
0021_00.01.57.550-00.01.57.990	UNMATCHED:  A bit confusing, but I promise the rest of the movie is much more linear.
0021_00.01.57.990-00.02.05.160	Marty arrives in the year 1885, a few days before Doc's murder, to find Hill Valley has a very Old West feel to it.
0021_00.02.05.160-00.02.16.290	When Marty arrives, he is right in the middle of a Native American attack and the DeLorean gets damaged, causing it to leak fuel, making it unable to accelerate to 88 miles per hour, the speed needed for time travel.
0021_00.02.16.290-00.02.24.740	So Marty and Doc devise an alternative plan to have a train push the car up to the necessary speed of 88 miles per hour.
0021_00.02.24.740-00.02.30.440	While working on the train plan, Doc and Marty see a woman on a horse drawn wagon that is traveling out of control.
0021_00.02.30.440-00.02.35.790	Doc saves the woman, who is the town's school teacher, named Clara.
0021_00.02.35.790-00.02.44.190	Clara and Doc end up falling in love eventually but it takes some time because Doc is concerned what she will think or do about him being a man from the future.
0021_00.02.44.190-00.02.52.740	Marty also meets his Irish relatives that he has descended from, that look exactly like him.
0021_00.02.52.740-00.02.53.190	UNMATCHED:  On the whole, they add very little to the story.
0021_00.02.53.190-00.03.05.740	Marty, Doc, Clara and Marty's family all go into the town's festival, where after a series of events, Marty yet again gets into a fight with a Tannen, this time being Mad Dog Tannen, the man who's supposed to kill Doc.
0021_00.03.05.740-00.03.09.830	The Sheriff breaks up their fight so Mad Dog decides to postpone the duel.
0021_00.03.09.830-00.03.14.360	Marty and Mad Dog end up having their duel, which Marty wins.
0021_00.03.14.360-00.03.18.450	Mad Dog ends up in a pile of manure and is arrested for an earlier robbery.
0021_00.03.18.450-00.03.45.570	I didn't go into a great deal of detail in my other summaries of these movies about this, but there are many repeating motifs between the different versions of these characters, such as:  Marty waking up to his mother, Biff getting arrested, and/or landing in manure, Marty getting angry and being called chicken, and many, many, many others.
0021_00.03.45.570-00.03.47.040	UNMATCHED:  Really, they aren't that important to the story, but it's an interesting element that they carry throughout the films. 
0021_00.03.47.040-00.03.51.700	After defeating Mad Dog, Marty, Doc and Clara begin the train plan.
0021_00.03.51.700-00.03.59.850	Following a series of events, only Marty takes off in the DeLorean to the year nineteen eighty-five, leaving Doc and Clara in the year 1885.
0021_00.03.59.850-00.04.02.870	The DeLorean is destroyed when it arrives, however.
0021_00.04.02.870-00.04.09.490	Marty returns to his girlfriend, Jennifer, who mind you, has been unconscious since the second film, who is now starting to wake up.
0021_00.04.09.490-00.04.20.080	Marty and Jennifer go back to the wreckage of the DeLorean when Doc appears in a train that has been fitted with a flux capacitor, making it a locomotive time machine.
0021_00.04.20.080-00.04.22.560	Doc is accompanied by Clara, among with their two children.
0021_00.04.22.560-00.04.29.970	The film ends with Doc and his family taking off in the locomotive, which flies away and into another time.
0021_00.04.29.970-00.04.34.660	Well that was the summary for the last and final Back to the Future movie.
0021_00.04.34.660-00.04.38.370	If you haven't checked out the other parts, please look at my other summaries.

0022_00.02.00.990-00.02.09.700	Bruce meets with the company's archivist, Lucius Fox, who gives Bruce access to a variety of prototype military weapons.
0022_00.02.09.700-00.02.19.950	Inspired by his fear, Bruce uses the equipment to dome the vigilante identity of Batman and sets up his base in the bat infested caves beneath his mansion.

0025_00.00.54.400-00.00.59.620	Later on in the film, they will get publicly engaged, which even further wins over the crowd.
0025_00.00.59.620-00.01.05.730	While on their tour, however, there are definite signs of uprising and defiance in the districts.

0025_00.01.35.700-00.01.41.870	With the games being composed of past winners, the ages range from rather young to quite old.
0025_00.01.41.870-00.01.45.660	Some are still in great shape, or rather cunning, others may not fare as well.
0025_00.01.45.660-00.01.51.230	As they prepare for the games, Katniss makes some allies with the other tributes.
0025_00.01.51.230-00.02.01.410	Katniss once again makes a big spectacle during the pregame interviews, showing herself off as a mockingjay, the bird that is on a pendant that she wears and sort of a symbol that represents her.
0025_00.02.01.410-00.02.08.040	Peeta, even in an interview, tries to get the games stopped, by saying she's pregnant, but that doesn't stop the games.

0025_00.02.35.370-00.02.45.500	Also aboard the aircraft is Katniss' mentor, as well as Plutarch, revealing that the game maker has betrayed the capitol.
0025_00.02.45.500-00.02.50.830	It appears it was all a plot to incite a rebellion and everyone was in on it except for Katniss.
0025_00.02.50.830-00.02.54.300	When Katniss wakes up, she is furious that the rebels did not save Peeta.
0025_00.02.54.300-00.02.58.160	UNMATCHED

0025_00.03.11.860-00.03.17.170	Clearly, this is a start of a civil war and this is where the film ends.
0025_00.03.17.170-00.03.19.460	So that was the spoilers for Catching Fire.

0026_00.01.32.710-00.01.39.220	She has traits for the selfless Abnegation, the intellectual Erudite, and the brave Dauntless.
0026_00.01.39.240-00.01.48.940	Beatrice's proctor tells her to keep these mixed results a secret, as the Divergent are considered uncontrollable threats to the government and are often eliminated.

0026_00.02.17.910-00.02.25.010	Only the best of the initiates will become members, and those that don't make it will become Factionless, essentially homeless.
0026_00.02.25.030-00.02.33.650	Tris make some friends amongst the initiates but also has some enemies, primarily an initiate named Peter who even tries to kill her at one point.
0026_00.02.33.660-00.02.37.180	There are two senior Dauntless members that oversee their training.
0026_00.02.37.210-00.02.47.360	The first is Four, a tough but kind Dauntless who Tris develops feelings for; and the second is Eric, a brutal and ruthless leader of the Dauntless.
0026_00.02.47.370-00.02.59.370	Tris passes through the first phase of her training after winning a "capture the flag" game and moves on to the second phase, where initiates will undergo serum-induced simulations of their greatest fears.
0026_00.02.59.380-00.03.04.400	Tris, however, is able to breeze through the simulations drastically quicker than the other initiates.
0026_00.03.04.420-00.03.12.520	The reason is because she is a Divergent, and because she is a Divergent serums don't work the same for her as they do for other initiates.
0026_00.03.12.530-00.03.20.790	Four takes notice of this, however, and warns her that she needs to hide her powers so she isn't persecuted for being a Divergent.
0026_00.03.20.810-00.03.32.570	Four and Tris begin to develop a romantic relationship, and Four reveals that his real name is Tobias Eaton and is the son of the leader of the Abnegation, Marcus Eaton, who used to abuse Four when he was much younger.
0026_00.03.32.580-00.03.41.050	Tris visits her brother Caleb who informs her that Erudite is planning to overthrow Abnegation in order to take over the government.
0026_00.03.41.070-00.03.46.290	Tris returns the Dauntless headquarters, completes her final test, and becomes a full member of the Dauntless.
0026_00.03.46.310-00.03.52.210	Afterwards, all the Dauntless are given a new serum that they are told is for tracking purposes.
0026_00.03.52.235-00.03.54.315	However, it is really a mind control serum.
0026_00.03.54.350-00.04.05.410	The next day, the Dauntless are activated and the mind-controlled Dauntless are sent to attack and execute the Abnegation faction under the control of the leaders of the Dauntless and the Erudite.
0026_00.04.05.420-00.04.11.580	Tris and any other Divergent are unaffected by the serum, however, as their Divergent ways makes them immune to the effects of the serum.
0026_00.04.11.590-00.04.19.530	Tris, however, blends into the mind-controlled Dauntless and eventually discovers that Four is also a Divergent and isn't being controlled.
0026_00.04.19.530-00.04.26.000	The Dauntless arrive where the Abnegation are and begin killing innocent Abnegation faction members.
0026_00.04.26.010-00.04.32.670	Tris and Four are found to be sentient, and Four is put into custody by Eric, and Tris is ordered to be executed.
0026_00.04.32.680-00.04.37.870	Tris's mother, however, saves Tris, but eventually her mother is shot and killed.
0026_00.04.37.880-00.04.42.210	Tris finds her father, brother, and Four's father, Marcus.
0026_00.04.42.220-00.04.54.920	The group sneaks into the Dauntless headquarters and fights there several mind-controlled Dauntless members, including some initiates and friends she knew, and eventually, Tris  encounters Peter, the rival initiate who tried to kill her.
0026_00.04.54.940-00.05.05.090	Peter is not mind-controlled, but Tris is able to defeat Peter and uses him to take them to the control room in order to deactivate the mind-controlled Dauntless.
0026_00.05.05.110-00.05.15.670	Tris's father is killed on the way and Tris travels in alone to find that Four is under the control of a much more powerful mind-control agent, and Four attacks Tris.
0026_00.05.15.690-00.05.24.400	Eventually, Tris is able to break Four's trance and they find that the leader of the Erudite, Jeanine, is going to have the Dauntless army execute all the Abnegation faction.
0026_00.05.24.430-00.05.31.320	They stop her and are able to deactivate all of the Dauntless, saving the Abnegation faction just in time.

0027_00.00.20.300-00.00.26.330	The film opens on a team of New York paranormal investigators, called the Ghostbusters.
0027_00.00.26.330-00.00.33.240	The team consists of Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz, Egon Spengler and a new hire, Winston Zeddemore.
0027_00.00.33.240-00.00.39.650	The Ghostbusters use high-tech equipment to capture ghosts and often cause a fair amount of destruction in the process.
0027_00.00.39.650-00.00.50.740	The Ghostbusters are hired by Dana Barrett, whose apartment has been haunted by a demonic spirit, named Zuul, who is the servant to Gozer the Gozerian, the Sumerian God of Destruction.
0027_00.00.50.740-00.00.57.530	Venkman tries to win the affection of Dana, however, he is also competing with Dana's neighbor, Lewis Tully.
0027_00.00.57.530-00.01.02.290	Dana is eventually possessed by Zuul, declaring herself the gatekeeper.
0027_00.01.02.290-00.01.07.100	Her neighbor, Lewis, is also possessed by another demon, declaring himself a key master.
0027_00.01.07.100-00.01.11.790	Both begin to talk about the coming of Gozer, so the Ghostbusters separate the two.
0027_00.01.11.790-00.01.22.510	While this is all going on, the Environmental Protection Agency has the Ghostbusters arrested for operating unlicensed waste handlers, as they are storing the captured ghosts in their facility.
0027_00.01.22.510-00.01.33.440	The EPA shuts down the containment system and a massive explosion occurs and all the ghosts that the Ghostbusters have captured are set free and begin causing havoc throughout New York.
0027_00.01.33.440-00.01.40.660	The possessed Lewis and Dana are able to meet up and transform into demonic hounds and begin the process of summoning Gozer.
0027_00.01.40.660-00.01.52.370	In jail, the Ghostbusters discover that Dana's apartment was built by a cult leader, named Ivo Shandor, who wanted to bring about the destruction of humanity and built the apartment as a conduit for summoning Gozer.
0027_00.01.52.370-00.01.59.990	The Ghostbusters are set free to fight the ghosts and travel to Dana's apartment's roof, but discover that Gozer has already arrived.

0027_00.02.13.740-00.02.18.580	Gozer reappears as a massive marshmallow man and begins attacking the city.
0027_00.02.18.580-00.02.24.180	The Ghostbusters take their energy streams and cross the stream, firing at Gozer's portal.
0027_00.02.24.180-00.02.28.410	This defeats Gozer and frees Dana and Lewis.
0027_00.02.28.410-00.02.34.620	Though covered in marshmallow fluff, the Ghostbusters are treated as heroes for saving the city of New York.
0027_00.02.34.620-00.02.36.890	So that was the spoilers for Ghostbusters.

0028_00.00.31.660-00.00.39.790	This film is littered with references to the original films, with many of the original cast showing up as other characters and other various cameos.
0028_00.00.39.790-00.00.50.290	The movie opens with physicist Erin Gilbert learning her research book on the existence of paranormal phenomena, co-authored with fellow physicist Abby Yates has been republished by Abby.
0028_00.00.50.290-00.00.53.950	This though ends Erin's bid for tenure at Columbia University.
0028_00.00.53.950-00.01.02.080	Erin confronts Abby, who is continuing to study the paranormal at a technical college with engineer Jillian Holtzman.
0028_00.01.02.080-00.01.16.990	In exchange for Abby removing the book from publication, Erin reluctantly agrees to assist her and Jillian in a paranormal investigation of a presumed haunted building where they witness and film a ghost, renewing Erin's belief in the paranormal.
0028_00.01.16.990-00.01.24.410	However, when the video of their investigation is posted online, Erin is denied her tenured and Abby and Jillian are also fired.
0028_00.01.24.410-00.01.35.120	Erin, Abby and Jillian open their own ghost-busting business and open an office above a Chinese restaurant and hire dim-witted, but handsome Kevin Beckman as a receptionist.

0028_00.01.40.990-00.01.48.450	They film the ghost and successfully test Jillian's proton containment laser, but the video is again dismissed as a hoax.
0028_00.01.48.450-00.01.55.410	Patty joins the team, providing a repurposed hearse from her grandfather, similar to the Echo One from the original films.
0028_00.01.55.410-00.02.05.290	Soon it is learned that the ghosts are being summoned by devices built by Rowan North, an occultist and a mad scientist, attempting to bring about the apocalypse.
0028_00.02.05.290-00.02.15.330	The Ghostbusters are brought to see the mayor who reveals that the city and the Department of Homeland Security are aware of New York's ghost problem, which is very different than the original films.
0028_00.02.15.330-00.02.20.540	While privately supporting the team's work, the mayor's office publicly denounced them as fraudsters.
0028_00.02.20.540-00.02.27.100	The Ghostbusters discover Rowan building a portal to the ghost dimension in the hotel basement.
0028_00.02.27.100-00.02.38.940	To avoid capture, Rowan deliberately electrocutes himself to death, after which Jillian deactivates the portal and realizes that he killed himself so that he could become a ghost and command a spirit army.
0028_00.02.38.940-00.02.43.080	Rowan returns as a powerful ghost, ultimately possessing Kevin, the receptionist.
0028_00.02.43.080-00.02.47.740	As Kevin, he opens the portal and releases hundreds of ghosts.
0028_00.02.47.750-00.02.55.040	The police and DHS are quickly subdued but the Ghostbusters fight through the army of ghosts to reach the portal.
0028_00.02.55.040-00.03.00.790	Rowan takes the form of a ghost, grows to enormous height and attacks the city.
0028_00.03.00.790-00.03.07.620	The team devises a plan to use a nuclear reactor to close the portal and return the ghosts to their own dimension.
0028_00.03.07.620-00.03.11.150	The plan succeeds but Rowan drags Abby into the portal with him.
0028_00.03.11.150-00.03.14.660	Erin leaps into the portal and rescues her.
0028_00.03.14.660-00.03.30.430	After the city is saved, the mayor's office agrees to secretly fund the Ghostbusters' research while continuing to publicly denounce them as frauds, however, New York lights up with thanks and tributes to the Ghostbusters.
0028_00.03.30.440-00.03.36.620	With new funding, the Ghostbusters move to a better facility, an unoccupied firehouse, the same one from the original film.
0028_00.03.36.620-00.03.47.660	In a post-credits scene, Patty listens to a recording of a ghost encounter and asks the others if they've ever heard of Zuul, the main ghost terrorizing New York in the first film.

0029_00.00.49.200-00.00.55.950	After an incident with Oscar's baby carriage that seemed supernatural, Dana contacts the Ghostbusters.
0029_00.00.55.950-00.01.04.510	Meanwhile, one of Dana's colleagues, Dr. Janosz Poha, becomes increasingly interested in the painting of Vigo and we see that Janosz is under the spell of the painting.

0029_00.01.35.370-00.01.40.280	The pink slime invades Dana's apartment and attacks both her and Oscar.
0029_00.01.40.280-00.01.49.950	The Ghostbusters discover that the slime can react to different emotions, both positive and negative and they believe that the slime is a result of negative attitudes of New York citizens.

0029_00.02.00.240-00.02.03.950	The Ghostbusters try to get into the slime-covered museum, but are unsuccessful.
0029_00.02.03.950-00.02.17.580	The Ghostbusters then utilize the slime's ability to react to positive energy and use a remixed version of the song, Higher and Higher, in order to animate the Statue of Liberty, which gets the on-looking citizens excited and happy, increasing the positive mood.
0029_00.02.17.580-00.02.27.330	They use the torch on the Statue of Liberty to break into the museum in order to fight Janosz and the spirit of Vigo.

0030_00.00.16.450-00.00.17.490	So let's get started.
0030_00.00.17.490-00.00.25.830	The film opens in 1999 with scientists investigating a colossal skeleton unearthed in a collapsed mine in the Philippines.

0030_00.00.51.070-00.00.55.660	Joe persuades Ford to accompany him to their old home in the quarantine zone to retrieve vital data.
0030_00.00.55.660-00.01.02.750	They successfully retrieve the data but are discovered by soldiers and taken to a secret facility in the power plant's ruins.

0030_00.01.14.640-00.01.21.450	Ford joins the search for the creature, named a MUTO, or a massive unidentified terrestrial organism.
0030_00.01.21.450-00.01.31.990	It is revealed to Ford that in 1954, a deep sea expedition triggered the appearance of Godzilla, a massive lizard monster, who they believe preys on the MUTO's.
0030_00.01.31.990-00.01.39.790	Ford reveals that Joe had monitored echolocation signals that indicated the MUTO was communicating with something, most likely a second MUTO.
0030_00.01.39.790-00.01.47.950	MUTO's feed off nuclear energy and the MUTO attacks a Russian submarine and drops it into land in Hawaii to eat the sub's nuclear material.

0030_00.02.31.080-00.02.39.450	The male MUTO steals the warhead and takes it to the female, who forms a nest around it in the Chinatown area.
0030_00.02.39.450-00.02.43.490	While Godzilla and the MUTO's battle, a strike team, including Ford, enters the city to find and disarm the warhead.
0030_00.02.43.490-00.02.48.220	Unable to access the timer, the rest of the team sets the warhead on a boat for disposal at sea.
0030_00.02.48.220-00.03.00.080	The MUTO's are eventually able to get the upper hand, but Ford blows up the MUTO nest, ultimately distracting the MUTO's long enough for Godzilla to emerge victorious, killing both the MUTO's.
0030_00.03.00.080-00.03.03.360	Godzilla then collapses on the city shore.
0030_00.03.03.360-00.03.08.970	WIth the rest of the team wiped out, Ford uses the last of his energy to get the boat with the warhead out to sea.
0030_00.03.08.970-00.03.13.580	He is rescued just before the warhead explodes and reunites with his family the following morning.
0030_00.03.13.580-00.03.20.120	Godzilla awakens, rising up from the destroyed San Francisco, and returns to sea.

0031_00.04.56.910-00.05.03.550	Afterwards, they travel to meet Gamora's buyer on a massive floating head, known as Knowhere.
0031_00.05.03.550-00.05.07.590	Knowhere is a seedy mining community with virtually no laws.
0031_00.05.07.590-00.05.32.570	Peter and Gamora meet up with the collector there, who reveals to them the true purpose of the orb: "Oh my new friends, before creation itself, there were six singularities, then the universe exploded into existence and the remnants of the system were forged into concentrated ingots."

0031_00.06.28.050-00.06.35.140	In a moment of desperation, Peter reaches out to Yondu, who ends up saving them from the cold and oxygenless space.
0031_00.06.35.140-00.06.46.400	Aboard the Dark Aster, Ronan, who has now realized what the orb actually contained, decides to take the infinity stone for himself and places it into his hammer.

0031_00.07.19.670-00.07.28.890	Peter contacts the Nova Corps on Xandar to alert them of Ronan's attack and also to let them know that the Ravagers will be helping protect the planet.
0031_00.07.28.890-00.07.36.360	Ronan's ship arrives at the planet, Xandar, along with a massive fleet of Kree fighter ships.
0031_00.07.36.360-00.07.43.710	While the Ravagers and the Nova Corps fight the fleet from the outside, Peter, Drax, Groot and Gamora punch a hole in the Dark Aster and enter in on foot.

0031_00.07.49.800-00.07.56.010	The Guardians fight their way through the inside, defeating Nebula and Ronan's soldiers.
0031_00.07.56.010-00.08.03.950	Eventually, the Guardians reach Ronan, but Ronan, coupled with the power of the infinity stone, clearly has the upper hand.
0031_00.08.03.950-00.08.15.520	It seems as though all hope is lost for the Guardians, however, while monologuing about his superior power, Rocket crashes his ship through a window, hitting Ronan, and causing the Dark Aster to fall out of the sky.
0031_00.08.15.520-00.08.23.780	As the Dark Aster is plummeting to Earth, Groot creates a protective wood ball around the group which will kill him, but protect the others.
0031_00.08.23.790-00.08.29.740	After the ship crashes, a huge wave of destruction occurs, crushing buildings and a good portion of the city.
0031_00.08.29.740-00.08.35.410	The group has survived, except for Groot, but unfortunately, so did Ronan.
0031_00.08.35.420-00.08.46.060	Once again, Ronan, being the high and mighty fanatic, starts monologuing about how he will destroy Xandar.
0031_00.08.46.060-00.08.48.360	Peter sees this as a great opportunity to create a distraction.
0031_00.08.48.360-00.08.49.960	Ooh child, things are gonna get easier.
0031_00.08.49.965-00.08.54.230	Ooh child, things will get brighter.

0031_00.10.27.320-00.10.29.920	Yondu takes the container and leaves the Guardians.
0031_00.10.29.920-00.10.39.260	As Yondu is leaving, he mentions to one of his crew how the Ravagers were originally hired to pick up Peter and bring Peter to his Dad.
0031_00.10.39.260-00.10.39.750	UNMATCHED:  This possibly could be a plot point for the next movie.
0031_00.10.39.750-00.10.51.290	Peter reveals, however, that he switched the container on Yondu, giving Yondu a troll doll, while giving the real infinity stone to the Nova Corps to be locked away and protected.
0031_00.10.51.290-00.10.57.570	As a reward for their service, the Nova Corps expunges all of the Guardians' criminal records.

0031_00.11.10.530-00.11.21.660	After the credits, on Knowhere, we see the collector, still damaged and hurt from earlier, being taunted by Howard the Duck.
0031_00.11.21.660-00.11.22.390	UNMATCHED:  To my understanding at this time, there is no plan for an actual Howard the Duck movie.
0031_00.11.22.390-00.11.23.270	UNMATCHED:  I think it was just a fun and goofy little thing they decided to add in.

0036_00.00.41.240-00.00.55.910	They bring in Dr. Alan Grant, paleontologist, Dr. Ellie Sattler, a paleobotanist, and Ian Malcolm, a mathematician, who are all blown away by the dinosaurs and the plant life the park has to offer.
0036_00.00.55.910-00.01.04.150	The group learns that the clone dinosaurs are a result of extracting DNA in blood found in mosquitoes that have been preserved in amber.
0036_00.01.04.150-00.01.10.360	The strand is often incomplete, so the DNA from frogs is used to fill in the gaps.
0036_00.01.10.360-00.01.13.270	As a safety precaution, all the clones are selected to be female to prevent breeding.
0036_00.01.13.270-00.01.20.330	Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex Murphy, are also brought to the park to see if it is actually fun for children.
0036_00.01.20.330-00.01.26.370	The group sets out on a tour of the park, while Hammond stays back in the control room to oversee the trip.
0036_00.01.26.370-00.01.31.290	Dr. Sattler separates herself from the group to help an injured triceratops.
0036_00.01.31.290-00.01.38.780	Later, a storm hits the island and cuts the tour short and the group is supposed to be brought back to the welcome area where they started the tour.
0036_00.01.38.780-00.01.52.210	While this is all going on, Nedry, a computer programmer that works on the island, deactivates the security system so he can steal a clone dinosaur embryo, which he intends to sell to a competitor of InGen.
0036_00.01.52.210-00.02.04.550	However, in deactivating the security system, he takes out the entire power grid, which deactivates the security fences around the dinosaurs as well as stops the tour vehicles, leaving the group stranded at night, in a storm, amongst the dinosaurs.
0036_00.02.04.550-00.02.13.530	A Tyrannosaurus Rex escapes and chases the group and catches the lawyer, Gennaro, as he's sitting on the toilet.
0036_00.02.13.530-00.02.17.780	As Nedry tries to escape, he becomes lost in the storm and is killed by a dilophosaurus.
0036_00.02.17.780-00.02.24.640	Dr. Sattler and the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, go searching for survivors but only find Malcolm.
0036_00.02.24.640-00.02.31.300	Unable to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer, Ray Arnold, decide to reboot the system.
0036_00.02.31.300-00.02.38.140	The group at the Visitors Center goes to the emergency bunker while Arnold goes to the maintenance shed to reboot the system.
0036_00.02.38.145-00.02.41.060	However, he does not return, so Dr Sattler and Muldoon travel to the shed themselves.
0036_00.02.41.060-00.03.04.270	Sattler heads into the shed to restart the power, while Muldoon attempts to fight the raptors outside and is ambushed and delivers the famous "Clever girl" line, and is killed.
0036_00.03.04.270-00.03.12.350	Meanwhile, Dr. Grant and Hammond's grandchildren discover broken shells of dinosaur eggs, which indicates that the dinosaurs have been reproducing.
0036_00.03.12.350-00.03.13.500	UNMATCHED: Dr. Grant reasons that it's because of some portion of frog DNA that the dinosaurs probably have where some frogs are able to change sex in certain environments.  
0036_00.03.13.500-00.03.22.290	UNMATCHED
0036_00.03.22.290-00.03.31.640	The three of them travel back to the Visitor Center to meet up with the others, where they are chased by velociraptors.
0036_00.03.31.640-00.03.35.480	When all hope is lost and they are cornered by the raptors, a Tyrannosaurus Rex appears and kills the raptors.
0036_00.03.35.480-00.03.43.510	The group escapes on a helicopter and Grant informs Hammond that he does not endorse the park to which Hammond agrees.
0036_00.03.43.510-00.03.45.660	Well that was the spoilers for Jurassic Park.

0037_00.00.14.500-00.00.16.510	So let's get started.
0037_00.00.16.510-00.00.26.420	The film opens on two tourists, Ben Hildebrand and Eric Kirby, who are parasailing around the dinosaur island of Isla Sorna, the island from the second film.
0037_00.00.26.420-00.00.31.120	Their boat is attacked and everyone aboard is killed, while Ben and Eric are still parasailing.
0037_00.00.31.120-00.00.34.060	They detach from the boat and sail into the island.
0037_00.00.34.060-00.00.46.240	The movie shifts to showing several of the characters from the first film, including Dr. Grant, who is famous for the events taking place in the original Jurassic Park, as well as Dr. Sattler, who is married and has two children.
0037_00.00.46.240-00.00.55.450	Dr. Grant and his assistant, Billy Brennan, are hired by a wealthy couple, Paul and Amanda Kirby, to get an aerial tour of Isla Sorna.
0037_00.00.55.450-00.01.04.860	The Kirby's tricked the team though, and they are actually a divorced couple and they intend to actually land on the island to save Ben, Amanda's boyfriend, and Eric, the Kirby's son.
0037_00.01.04.860-00.01.09.590	Grant attempts to protest, but the Kirby's hired mercenaries knock him out.
0037_00.01.09.590-00.01.18.310	After a rough landing involving both an attack from a Spinosaurus and a T-Rex, the remaining survivors escape to search for Ben and Eric.
0037_00.01.18.310-00.01.23.040	They find the parasail in a tree, where they also find some Raptor eggs, causing them to flee.
0037_00.01.23.040-00.01.31.750	They run and hide in an abandoned InGen compound, where they are pursued by Raptors and other dinosaurs, and a few of the members of the group are picked off.
0037_00.01.31.750-00.01.41.220	Dr. Grant ends up finding Eric, the Kirby's son, holding out in a pseudo bunker, however, Amanda's boyfriend, Ben, was not so lucky.
0037_00.01.41.220-00.01.51.550	Grant starts to believe that the Raptors are actually searching for something and later on discovers that his assistant, Billy, actually stole some of the Raptor eggs and that's why the Raptors are so viciously pursuing them.
0037_00.01.51.550-00.01.58.600	The group mistakenly enters into the Pteranodon's house, which attack the group and Eric is picked up and carried away.
0037_00.01.58.600-00.02.04.790	Billy saves Eric by using the parasail, however, Billy himself is attacked by the Pteranodons.
0037_00.02.04.790-00.02.08.790	The group escapes the Pteranodon's house, only to leave the door open by mistake.
0037_00.02.08.790-00.02.12.510	They escape down the river using a small boat that they had found.
0037_00.02.12.510-00.02.20.900	They find a ringing phone that they had lost much earlier in the movie, after the Spinosaurus ate it, and pick it up in order to contact Dr. Sattler.
0037_00.02.20.900-00.02.28.590	However, the Spinosaurus comes back, attacks the boat, which is eventually scared off after the boat's fuel is set on fire.
0037_00.02.28.590-00.02.33.240	Eventually they all make it to shore, only to be surrounded by Raptors still wanting their eggs back.
0037_00.02.33.240-00.02.42.220	Dr. Grant has Amanda return the eggs to them, while using a Raptor larynx that he had 3D printed to try to sort of communicate with the pack.
0037_00.02.42.220-00.02.47.660	When they run to the coast, they find that the US Marines and Navy have arrived to help them.
0037_00.02.47.660-00.02.52.000	They also find that Billy survived the Pteranodon attack, but is very injured.
0037_00.02.52.005-00.02.59.370	The film comes to an end and we see the group leaving the island, only to see Pteranodons flying free, most likely looking for new nesting ground.

0039_00.00.15.990-00.00.17.800	So let's get started.
0039_00.00.17.800-00.00.25.120	The film follows a giant panda named Po, who lives with his goose father, Mr. Ping, and works in a noodle restaurant.
0039_00.00.25.120-00.00.39.110	Po is a kung fu fanatic who idolizes the Furious Five, composed of Crane, Mantis, Monkey, Tigress, and Viper, all of whom are Kung Fu warriors, led by Master Shifu.
0039_00.00.39.110-00.00.41.840	Po wishes to become a master himself.
0039_00.00.41.840-00.00.56.840	We find Grand Master Oogway, Master Shifu's mentor, has had a vision of Shifu's adoptive son and former student, Tai Lung, that will escape from prison and come back to the Valley of Peace to take revenge for being denied the dragon scroll.
0039_00.00.56.840-00.01.02.480	The dragon scroll has been told to have the secret of limitless power.
0039_00.01.02.480-00.01.13.070	Shifu, concerned about Tai Lung's possible escape, sends a goose messenger to warn the guards, however, one of the feathers from the goose falls and Tai Lung is able to escape from prison.
0039_00.01.13.070-00.01.24.700	While all this is going on, Shifu holds a Kung Fu tournament in the hopes of identifying the mystical dragon warrior, the one who's supposed to be worthy of the dragon scroll and capable of defeating Tai Lung.
0039_00.01.24.700-00.01.31.180	Po arrives at the tournament to sell noodles but is unable to actually see what's going on in the tournament.
0039_00.01.31.180-00.01.39.790	Desperate to see what is going on, he strapped some fireworks to himself and lands right in the middle of the arena, right as Oogway is selecting the Dragon Warrior.
0039_00.01.39.790-00.01.42.500	To everyone's surprise, Po is proclaimed the Dragon Warrior.
0039_00.01.42.500-00.01.50.630	Shifu believes that Oogway is mistaken in thinking Po is the Dragon Warrior and tries to get Po to quit, which can be seen though his training montage.
0039_00.01.50.630-00.01.57.580	The Furious Five are also not happy about the selection, especially Tigress, who thought she should be the Dragon Warrior herself.
0039_00.01.57.580-00.02.06.020	Oogway convinces Shifu to promise to train Po and Oogway turns into a cloud of peach blossoms, presumably dying.
0039_00.02.06.020-00.02.15.700	Shifu realizes that Po can perform some amazing feats, so long as he is motivated by food and he uses this knowledge in order to train Po.
0039_00.02.15.700-00.02.22.840	While Po is completing his training, the Furious Five set out to take on Tai Lung, believing Po will be unable to defeat him. 
0039_00.02.22.840-00.02.26.130	Tai Lung is quickly able to defeat the Furious Five and continues to the valley.
0039_00.02.26.140-00.02.32.070	Shifu gives Po the dragon scroll, but it is revealed that there is actually nothing on the scroll.
0039_00.02.32.070-00.02.38.140	Shifu, believing the scroll is useless, has the Furious Five and Po evacuate the valley as Tai Lung arrives.
0039_00.02.38.140-00.02.50.750	Po finds his father, who decides to console Po by telling him the secret ingredient to his secret ingredient soup that is super famous, telling him that nothing is actually the secret ingredient.
0039_00.02.50.750-00.02.55.770	Po's father explains that the soup is special because people believe it is.
0039_00.02.55.770-00.03.03.220	Po realizes that this is the same concept that applies to the Dragon scroll and that the limitless power comes from within the Dragon Warrior.
0039_00.03.03.220-00.03.08.580	Po returns back to the temple to fight Tai Lung before Tai Lung can kill Shifu.
0039_00.03.08.580-00.03.14.660	Po and Tai Lung fight while Tai Lunch tries to read the Dragon scroll.
0039_00.03.14.660-00.03.16.660	Tai Lung eventually does read the scroll, but does not understand the message
0039_00.03.16.670-00.03.21.430	Po is able to defeat Tai Lung and the valley is saved.
0039_00.03.21.430-00.03.28.590	The villagers rejoice with the Furious Five and Shifu, who attempts to attain inner peace, now that the valley is safe.
0039_00.03.28.590-00.03.31.090	So that was the spoilers for Kung Fu Panda.

0040_00.00.42.470-00.00.50.000	Lord Shen learns from a fortune-teller that a warrior of black and white will one day defeat him if he does not change his ways.
0040_00.00.50.000-00.00.56.160	In response, Lord Shen leads an army of wolves to exterminate all the pandas in the land out of fear that a panda is the foretold warrior.
0040_00.00.56.160-00.01.02.850	Back in present day, we find Po and the Furious Five are protecting the valley under the guidance of Master Shifu.
0040_00.01.02.850-00.01.11.300	While defending a village from wolves working for Shen, Po notices a symbol on the leader's armor, causing Po to have a flashback of his mother.

0040_00.01.30.690-00.01.36.500	Po and the Furious Five set out to Gongman City to stop Shen and destroy the weapon.
0040_00.01.36.500-00.01.41.230	When they arrive, however, they are captured by Shen's wolves and are brought before Shen.
0040_00.01.41.230-00.01.45.870	The heroes, however, are able to free themselves and destroy Shen's weapon.

0042_00.01.24.860-00.01.30.650	The War Boy, Nux, also joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car to continue his blood supply.

0042_00.02.53.050-00.03.02.580	The group realizes that they have very few options and decide to travel back to Joe's Citadel, as it is not defended at the moment, and Joe has a very large supply of water.

0042_00.03.32.240-00.03.38.530	The group is cheered and welcomed by the remaining War Boys and Max walks off into the distance.
0042_00.03.38.530-00.03.41.550	So that was the spoilers for Mad Max, Fury Road.

0043_00.00.17.735-00.00.19.440	So let's get started.
0043_00.00.19.440-00.00.23.930	Information about this movie somewhat relies on the fact that you've seen the other films.
0043_00.00.23.930-00.00.31.420	If you need a quick reminder, check out my spoilers in the links below.
0043_00.00.31.420-00.00.38.320	The film opens with IMF agent, Trevor Hannah, who attempted to intercept a courier working for someone known as Cobalt.
0043_00.00.38.320-00.00.44.810	Trevor, however, is killed by the assissin Sabine Moreau and the briefcase he has is stolen.
0043_00.00.44.810-00.00.50.800	The film then switches to Ethan Hunt, who is being broken out of a Moscow jail by Benji Dunn and Jane Carter.
0043_00.00.50.800-00.00.54.820	While escaping, Ethan also frees a Russian source known as Bogdan.
0043_00.00.54.820-00.01.02.360	The IMF team goes to the Kremlin in order to find files about the true identity of Cobalt.
0043_00.01.02.360-00.01.11.330	However, during this mission they're compromised by someone and then that same person bombs the Kremlin and Ethan is injured.
0043_00.01.11.330-00.01.20.140	Ethan wakes up in a hospital to a Russian agent, Anatoly Sidorov, arresting Ethan, believing that he is the cause of the Kremlin bombing.
0043_00.01.20.140-00.01.24.110	Ethan escapes and has the IMF secretary extract him.
0043_00.01.24.110-00.01.37.220	The secretary tells him that the Russians believe that the Kremlin bombing was an act of war from the US and the president has issued a Ghost Protocol, disavowing the IMF and Ethan and his team are taking the blame.
0043_00.01.37.220-00.01.41.630	The secretary knows it's not his fault and tells him that there's a nearby cache of IMF supplies.
0043_00.01.41.630-00.01.45.400	Their car is attacked by Russian forces and Ethan escapes.
0043_00.01.45.400-00.01.53.060	His team is already at the cache and he is joined by intelligence analyst, William Brandt.
0043_00.01.53.060-00.01.56.980	With IMF being disavowed, Brandt's knowledge and ability to identify important figures is key.
0043_00.01.56.980-00.02.03.640	Brandt identifies Cobalt as Kurt Hendricks, a Russian nuclear strategist, whose goal is to start a nuclear war.
0043_00.02.03.640-00.02.07.620	Hendricks bombed the Kremlin in order to distract from the fact that he was stealing a Russian nuclear launch control device.
0043_00.02.07.620-00.02.15.130	However, he still needs the activation codes which he was supposed to get from the courier at the beginning of the film.
0043_00.02.15.130-00.02.22.390	The team travels to Dubai in order to intercept an exchange between Moreau and Hendrick's right-hand man, Wistrom.
0043_00.02.22.390-00.02.25.830	Moreau and Wistrom have never met, so they trick them into different rooms.
0043_00.02.25.830-00.02.30.610	Moreau meets with Ethan and Brandt while Wistrom meets with Jane.
0043_00.02.30.610-00.02.35.570	Wistrom also brought an expert with him in order to verify that he's receiving the real launch codes.
0043_00.02.35.570-00.02.43.730	Through some sleight of hand and fancy gadgets, they're able to trick both parties and they attempt to follow Wistrom in order to locate Hendricks.
0043_00.02.43.730-00.02.45.710	A fight breaks out between both groups.
0043_00.02.45.710-00.02.54.270	Moreau is killed and Wistrom escapes, however, while Wistrom is escaping, it is revealed that Wistrom is really Hendricks in disguise.
0043_00.02.54.270-00.02.57.210	Afterwards, Ethan leaves to go meet with an informant.
0043_00.02.57.210-00.03.06.530	While Ethan is gone, it is revealed by Brandt that Ethan's wife, Julia, who we thought from the beginning of the film was just divorced or separated from Ethan, was actually killed.
0043_00.03.06.530-00.03.19.320	Ethan meets with Bogdan, the man Ethan saved from the Moscow prison and Bogdan's cousin, an arms dealer, who explained that Hendricks still needs to access a military satellite in order to trigger the missiles and that the most likely target will be an Indian telecommunications company.
0043_00.03.19.320-00.03.23.170	The team travels to Mumbai in order to disable the satellite before Hendricks can fire the missile.
0043_00.03.23.175-00.03.27.375	UNMATCHED
0043_00.03.27.375-00.03.37.080	Hendricks, however, is successful at firing the missile before they can disable the satellite so Ethan decides he must abort the nuclear warhead directly from the panel Hendricks used to fire the missile.
0043_00.03.37.080-00.03.48.140	They break into a fight, Hendricks dies and at the last second, Ethan disables the missile before it strikes the city of San Fransisco.
0043_00.03.48.140-00.03.55.500	Sidorov enters right as the missile is aborted, realizes Ethan is really on their side and that he is innocent of the Kremlin bombing.
0043_00.03.55.500-00.03.59.610	The team meets up a few weeks later with Luther and accepts a new mission.
0043_00.03.59.610-00.04.07.940	Ethan reveals to Brandt that Julia is actually alive and the film ends with Julia and Ethan smiling at each other from a distance.
0043_00.04.07.940-00.04.11.280	So that was the spoilers from Mission Impossible, Ghost Protocol.

0044_00.00.11.360-00.00.16.530	Today we are talking about the 1996 film, Mission Impossible, the first film in the Mission Impossible series.
0044_00.00.16.530-00.00.17.980	So let's get started.
0044_00.00.17.980-00.00.24.520	The film starts out following Jim Phelps, the head of a team known as the Impossible Mission Force, or IMF.
0044_00.00.24.520-00.00.31.290	The team is being used to intercept a man in Prague who is trying to steal the IMF non-official cover list, also known as the NOC list, which links code names of agents to their real names.
0044_00.00.31.290-00.00.34.560	UNMATCHED
0044_00.00.34.560-00.00.37.270	This would be highly valuable to those who want to get rid of these agents.
0044_00.00.37.270-00.00.46.710	However, the mission goes wrong, and nearly the entire team is killed, including the team lead, Jim Phelps and his wife, Claire.
0044_00.00.46.710-00.00.47.440	All except Ethan Hunt, who does survive.
0044_00.00.47.440-00.00.49.810	Ethan sets up a meeting with the IMF director, Eugene Kittredge.
0044_00.00.49.810-00.01.03.980	Ethan finds out that the whole job was a ruse to try to lure out a mole in the IMF, who has been communicating with an arms dealer named Max, as part of something known as Job 314.
0044_00.01.03.980-00.01.12.120	Kittredge suspects that Ethan is the mole as he is the sole survivor of the mission and Ethan realizes he is surrounded by IMF agents.
0044_00.01.12.120-00.01.17.360	Ethan escapes and returns back to his safe house.

0044_00.02.18.830-00.02.29.330	Jim tells Ethan that Kittredge is behind the whole attack, which Ethan pretends to agree with, but Ethan realizes that Jim is the mole, who is the reason his team is dead, and is really Job.

0044_00.02.35.270-00.02.38.950	Ethan sets up an exchange for the NOC list on a high speed train.
0044_00.02.38.950-00.02.44.920	While Max attempts to verify the list, Ethan takes the 10 million dollars and Claire comes to meet him.
0044_00.02.44.920-00.02.51.180	However, Claire reaches the baggage car and meets with her husband, Jim, where she talks about whether they should kill Ethan or not.
0044_00.02.51.180-00.02.57.010	However, Jim is not actually Jim, but Ethan wearing a mask in a ploy to test whether Claire is working with Jim.
0044_00.02.57.010-00.03.02.130	The real Jim appears and takes the 10 million dollars from Ethan.

0045_00.00.17.400-00.00.18.830	So let's get started.
0045_00.00.18.830-00.00.22.890	The information about this movie somewhat relies that you've seen the previous film.
0045_00.00.22.895-00.00.26.820	If you need a quick reminder, watch my spoiler by clicking the link below.
0045_00.00.26.820-00.00.36.540	The film opens with a Russian biochemist, Dr. Vladimir, of Biocyte Pharmaceuticals, injecting himself with a new bio-weapon, known as Chimera.
0045_00.00.36.540-00.00.40.450	Chimera is a highly deadly virus that Dr. Vladimir was forced to make by his company.
0045_00.00.40.450-00.00.48.910	Dr. Vladimir plans to take the cure, known as Bellerophon, to the United States aboard a plane, where he is met by a man who is disguised as Ethan Hunt.
0045_00.00.48.910-00.00.56.330	Dr. Vladimir is attacked, the cure is stolen, and the plane is crashed, killing Dr. Vladimir and the passengers aboard.
0045_00.00.56.330-00.01.06.120	Dr. Vladimir was able to contact the IMF prior to his death, and they are worried that the former IMF agent, Sean Ambrose, is behind the attack and will release the virus.

0045_00.01.17.410-00.01.26.030	The team investigates Sean's headquarters and also investigates Sean at a horse race track, and are able to steal some information from him about the Chimera virus.
0045_00.01.26.030-00.01.34.410	They discover once a person is infected, they only have a 20 hour window that the cure, Bellerophon, can be used, and after that, the infected person will die.
0045_00.01.34.410-00.01.43.690	The IMF team then kidnaps John C. McCloy, the CEO of Biocyte Pharmaceuticals, who developed the virus and the cure.
0045_00.01.43.690-00.01.53.080	They find that Sean only has the cure to the virus, but not the virus itself, so the IMF team attempts to break into the Biocyte facilities to destroy the remaining virus, however, Sean is there with his men.
0045_00.01.53.090-00.01.58.290	Sean also brought Nyah with him, who he uses to retrieve the virus, knowing that Ethan will not shoot her.
0045_00.01.58.290-00.02.03.490	Nyah, however, injects herself with the last remaining strain of the virus, infecting herself.
0045_00.02.03.490-00.02.10.410	She knows that this will protect her from being killed by Sean, at least until he can find a way to properly use the virus.
0045_00.02.10.410-00.02.17.650	Sean decides to let Nyah out in the streets of Sydney in hopes of triggering a pandemic, causing massive demand for the cure, Bellerophon.
0045_00.02.17.650-00.02.29.260	Sean also forces McCloy to sell him enough shares of Biocyte to give Sean the majority control.
0045_00.02.29.270-00.02.30.080	UNMATCHED:  With the incredibly high demand for Bellerophon, Biocyte's stock price will greatly increase, making Sean an obscene amount of money.
0045_00.02.30.080-00.02.34.460	However, Ethan breaks in the meeting and steals the samples of Bellerophon.
0045_00.02.34.460-00.02.40.910	Nyah has walked to a cliffside in order to kill herself and keep herself from other people, to prevent them from getting the virus.
0045_00.02.40.910-00.02.51.280	There is a long chase, then a showdown between Sean and Ethan, but Ethan wins in the end and gets the cure to Nyah.
0045_00.02.51.280-00.02.51.685	UNMATCHED:  There is no sign left of the virus, and mission is complete
0045_00.02.51.685-00.02.56.575	The IMF clears Nyah's criminal history, and Ethan continues his vacation with her in Sydney.

0046_00.00.17.110-00.00.18.550	So let's get started.
0046_00.00.18.550-00.00.21.390	These spoilers rely heavily on that you've seen the other films.
0046_00.00.21.400-00.00.26.410	If you haven't seen my other videos on the Hunger Game films, I suggest checking them out on the links below.
0046_00.00.26.410-00.00.33.730	This portion of the Hunger Games stories is separated into two parts, with the second part coming out later in 2015.
0046_00.00.33.730-00.00.38.360	The film opens with Katniss being in District 13, the headquarters of the Rebellion led by President Coin.
0046_00.00.38.380-00.00.46.880	Coin explains to Katniss that her role in the Rebellion will be to be a symbol of the uprising, and will be known as the Mockingjay.
0046_00.00.46.880-00.00.53.530	At first she does not want to be a symbol, but when she sees her home district and how it was destroyed by the Capitol, she decides to become a symbol.
0046_00.00.53.530-00.01.04.810	She is constantly filmed so that everything can be used as footage for propaganda and use that footage to splay over hack TV channels across all of Panem.
0046_00.01.04.810-00.01.16.320	However, in exchange for being the Rebellion's Mockingjay, she demands that the Rebels get Peeta back, who was captured by the Capitol and is being used and abused by the Capitol to make their own counter-propaganda.
0046_00.01.16.320-00.01.27.070	Katniss is fitted with a specially designed outfit, given her own camera crew, Effie Trinket as her stylist, and Gale as her bodyguard.
0046_00.01.27.070-00.01.36.090	Katniss travels to various districts, sometimes fighting, sometimes just visiting the wreckage, but all the actions are filmed and used for propaganda.
0046_00.01.36.090-00.01.46.720	In a live counter-propaganda speech from Peeta, he warns District 13 that they're about to be attacked, which obviously he wasn't supposed to say, and is beaten and maybe possibly killed.
0046_00.01.46.720-00.01.53.230	District 13 has enough time to prepare for the attack, and after the attack is over they send out a team to rescue Peeta.
0046_00.01.53.230-00.01.56.270	Peeta is rescued.
0046_00.01.56.270-00.02.02.700	However, when Katniss goes to meet him, Peeta tries to kill Katniss and it is found that he is been "hijacked" or brainwashed using venom from tracker checkers.
0046_00.02.02.700-00.02.11.630	So Peeta is kept in isolation, and the Rebellion plans to move forward with their war, and thus concluding the film.
0046_00.02.11.630-00.02.14.310	So that was the Spoilers for Mockingjay: Part One.

0047_00.01.00.890-00.01.05.390	The Jedis are viewed as the good guys throughout the films.
0047_00.01.05.390-00.01.10.730	The Trade Federation is working under the direction of Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord.
0047_00.01.10.730-00.01.17.130	The Siths are kind of the evil opposite of the Jedi, more of the dark side of The Force.
0047_00.01.17.130-00.01.22.060	The Jedi arrive to negotiate with Viceroy Gunray, the leader of the Federation.
0047_00.01.22.060-00.01.29.340	However, the Viceroy is ordered to kill the Jedi and invade the planet of Naboo with a droid army.

0047_00.02.00.310-00.02.04.820	The damaged ship lands on the desert planet of Tatooine in order to repair its hyperdrive.
0047_00.02.04.820-00.02.18.500	Qui-Gon, Jar Jar, a droid named R2D2, and Queen Amidala's handmaiden, Padme, all go to the city of Mos Espa to find the parts that are needed.
0047_00.02.18.500-00.02.25.800	They find a shop owned by an alien named Watto, and his slave, a nine year old boy named Anakin Skywalker.
0047_00.02.25.800-00.02.30.910	Anakin is a skilled engineer, having built a robot assisted droid named C-3PO.
0047_00.02.30.910-00.02.36.520	Anakin is also a talented pod racer, a type of dangerous high-speed racing.
0047_00.02.36.520-00.02.47.060	Qui-Gon can tell that Anakin has an extremely strong tie to The Force and appears to be the chosen one that the Jedi prophecy foretells of, the one that should bring balance to The Force.
0047_00.02.47.060-00.02.54.030	Qui-Gon tries to use his money that they have in order to buy their parts, but Watto is not interested in their foreign currency.

0047_00.03.02.340-00.03.09.620	Qui-Gon also tries to barter for Anakin's mother, Shmi, but is unsuccessful.
0047_00.03.09.620-00.03.12.140	Anakin wins the race and they get the hyperdrive they need.

0047_00.03.38.410-00.03.46.310	While she is doing this, Qui-Gon takes Anakin before the Jedi Council to request that he be trained as a Jedi.
0047_00.03.46.310-00.03.51.470	The Council feels that he is too concerned with his emotions and he has potential to be swayed to the dark side of The Force.
0047_00.03.51.470-00.03.54.330	Qui-Gon vows however, to train Anakin himself.
0047_00.03.54.330-00.04.04.330	Queen Amidala is frustrated with the corruption in the Senate and cannot wait for the vote of no confidence to go through, so she returns back to the planet of Naboo with a Jedi.

0054_00.00.15.830-00.00.17.150	So let's get started.
0054_00.00.17.155-00.00.20.670	The summary relies heavily on knowledge of the previous film.
0054_00.00.20.670-00.00.29.120	If you haven't seen it already, check out my spoiler for the Terminator film in the link below.
0054_00.00.29.120-00.00.35.330	The film opens in the year 1995 where John Connor is now 10 years old, living with his foster parents.
0054_00.00.35.330-00.00.44.410	His Mom, Sarah Connor, was arrested for attempting to bomb a computer factory, presumably one related to Skynet, and is placed in a mental hospital.
0054_00.00.44.410-00.00.50.690	The robots in the future have sent a new Terminator, known as the T1000 back to kill John.
0054_00.00.50.690-00.00.57.350	T1000 is made of an amorphous metal-like substance, allowing to change his shape and appearance.
0054_00.00.57.355-00.01.01.180	Primarily, however, he looks like a policeman that he killed in the beginning of the film.
0054_00.01.01.180-00.01.13.400	In order to defend his younger self, the future John Connor has sent back a reprogrammed T800 Terminator, who looks very much like the Terminator who tried to kill his mother in the first film, still played by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
0054_00.01.13.400-00.01.17.610	Both the T1000 and the Terminator find John at a shopping mall.
0054_00.01.17.610-00.01.22.770	A chase ensues and John and the Terminator escape.
0054_00.01.22.770-00.01.29.540	John convinces the Terminator to break his mother out of the mental hospital, though initially, she is terrified, as she thinks the Terminator is there to try to kill her.
0054_00.01.29.540-00.01.33.890	The three of them are chased by the T1000, but they escape.
0054_00.01.33.890-00.01.36.890	UNMATCHED
0054_00.01.36.900-00.01.48.460	The Terminator informs John and Sarah that when the new program Skynet, an artificial intelligence, goes live, it will initiate a nuclear holocaust, known as Judgment Day, and then it will continue to create machines to exterminate the remainder of humanity.
0054_00.01.48.460-00.01.57.060	Sarah finds out the primary man behind Skynet is Miles Bennet Dyson, who works for Cyberdyne Systems.
0054_00.01.57.060-00.01.59.870	Miles is creating a new neural net CPU, which is the basis of Skynet.
0054_00.01.59.870-00.02.03.650	Sarah decides to try to kill Miles in order to prevent Judgment Day from occurring.
0054_00.02.03.650-00.02.09.790	When Sarah corners Miles in his home, she wounds him, but is unable to execute him in front of his family.
0054_00.02.09.790-00.02.22.670	They instead warn him of the consequences that his work will bring about and Miles reveals that most of his research came from reverse engineering technology from the arm of the destroyed Terminator robot from the first film.
0054_00.02.22.670-00.02.28.000	The group then breaks into the Cyberdyne building in order to destroy the Terminator arm and CPU stored there.
0054_00.02.28.000-00.02.39.110	The group obtains the CPU and the arm, then the police arrive and Miles is shot, but he is able to destroy the lab and his research and sacrifices himself.
0054_00.02.39.110-00.02.51.760	The T1000 continues to chase the group into a steel mill and the Terminator tries to hold the T1000 off, and eventually the T1000 is destroyed by a grenade launcher and a vat of lava.
0054_00.02.51.760-00.02.53.960	John throws the arm and the CPU into the vat, as well.
0054_00.02.53.970-00.02.57.240	The Terminator then decides to self-terminate so he can never be reverse engineered like the arm was.
0054_00.02.57.240-00.03.04.670	He lowers himself into the vat and the film ends with Sarah thinking about the future.
0054_00.03.04.670-00.03.07.820	So that was the spoilers for Terminator 2, Judgment Day.

0055_00.00.29.180-00.00.34.850	The film opens with John Connor living off the grid in Los Angeles after the death of this mother, Sarah, from leukemia.
0055_00.00.34.850-00.00.44.060	Even though Judgment Day, the mass destruction of human lives by the machines was avoided, John still believes that the war will happen between the humans and the machines.
0055_00.00.44.060-00.00.57.450	The future Skynet, which apparently still exists, unable to locate where John is hiding in the past, sends back a new Terminator called the TX, to the year 2004 in order to kill other members of the human resistance.
0055_00.00.57.450-00.01.01.750	The TX has similar liquid metal properties of the T1000 from the second film.
0055_00.01.01.750-00.01.07.280	It also has advanced built-in weaponry, as well as the ability to reprogram other machines.
0055_00.01.07.280-00.01.16.440	In response, the future human resistance sends back a reprogrammed Terminator to protect John Connor and his future wife, Kate Brewster.
0055_00.01.16.440-00.01.20.240	However, at the beginning of the film, Kate and John do not know each other.
0055_00.01.20.240-00.01.25.530	The Terminator looks just like the Terminators from the previous films, again played by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
0055_00.01.25.530-00.01.32.610	After killing several targets, the TX locates Kate and John, but they escape with the Terminator's help.
0055_00.01.32.610-00.01.40.440	The Terminator takes Kate and John to a mausoleum where John's mother, Sarah Connor, is buried, however, in her vault, they find a massive weapons cache.
0055_00.01.40.440-00.01.48.860	A shootout takes place with the police and they all escape in a hearse.
0055_00.01.48.860-00.01.53.880	The Terminator plans on taking John and Kate to Mexico in order to escape the fallout of the new Judgment Day, which is actually supposed to happen that same day.
0055_00.01.53.880-00.01.57.830	It appears as though that Judgment Day is inevitable and all that happened in the second film was they merely pushed the Judgment Day back further.
0055_00.01.57.830-00.02.01.750	UNMATCHED
0055_00.02.01.750-00.02.11.690	John orders the Terminator to take them to see Kate's father, a Lieutenant General, overseeing the building of Skynet after Cyberdyne Systems went defunked.
0055_00.02.11.690-00.02.18.970	At first, the Terminator resists John's orders, but follows through when Kate gives the same order.
0055_00.02.18.970-00.02.27.510	It is revealed that John is killed on July 4th, 2032, by the same Terminator robot, and that the future Kate is actually who reprogrammed the Terminator and sent him back in time.
0055_00.02.27.510-00.02.34.410	Kate's father is pressured by the President to activate Skynet in order to stop a computer virus that is spreading all throughout the world.
0055_00.02.34.410-00.02.38.390	Little do they realize, the virus is actually Skynet itself.
0055_00.02.38.390-00.02.46.740	John and Kate are too late to stop Skynet's activation, and the machines begin to kill staff members and the TX also arrives and begins fighting.
0055_00.02.46.740-00.02.49.780	The General gives Kate and John a code book for the location of Skynet's core system in order to disable Skynet.
0055_00.02.49.790-00.02.53.640	UNMATCHED
0055_00.02.53.640-00.02.59.360	John and Kate make a run for an airplane at the base while the Terminator is severely damaged by TX.
0055_00.02.59.360-00.03.05.100	John and Kate are able to escape, however, and reach Crystal Peak, where the Skynet core is located.
0055_00.03.05.100-00.03.10.340	As they arrive, however, the TX and the Terminator also arrive and they begin to battle.

0055_00.03.15.860-00.03.19.020	The Terminator holds the blast doors open long enough for John and Kate to lock themselves in.
0055_00.03.19.020-00.03.23.460	Then the Terminator uses the fuel cells to destroy the TX and himself.
0055_00.03.23.460-00.03.30.310	Kate and John discover, however, that Crystal Peak is not a site for Skynet's core, but instead is a nuclear fallout shelter.
0055_00.03.30.310-00.03.40.190	The General tricked them in order to protect his daughter, Kate, as well as John, as Judgment Day begins to happen outside of the bunker, with nuclear missiles being detonated all around them, killing billions.
0055_00.03.40.190-00.03.47.720	The film ends with Kate and John answering radio calls on the emergency equipment, knowing that the war with the machines has truly begun.
0055_00.03.47.720-00.03.51.090	So that was the spoilers for Terminator 3, Rise of the Machines.

0056_00.00.11.445-00.00.17.140	Today we're going to be talking about the 2009 film, Terminator Salvation, the fourth Terminator film.
0056_00.00.17.140-00.00.18.200	So let's get started.
0056_00.00.18.205-00.00.21.200	The summary relies heavily on knowledge of the previous films.
0056_00.00.21.200-00.00.30.180	If you haven't seen them already, check out my spoilers in the links below.
0056_00.00.30.180-00.00.40.670	The film begins in 2003 with Dr. Kogan, of Cyberdyne Systems, convincing a death row inmate, Marcus Wright, to sign over his body for medical research after his execution.
0056_00.00.40.670-00.00.48.570	A year after this, Skynet is activated and billions of humans are killed by machines in a nuclear event known as Judgment Day.
0056_00.00.48.570-00.01.02.180	The film transitions to the year 2018, where John Connor is leading an attack on a Cybernet base, where he discovers human prisoners and schematics of a new type of Terminator, which will incorporate living tissue.
0056_00.01.02.180-00.01.05.430	John is the only survivor after the base is destroyed by a nuclear explosion.
0056_00.01.05.430-00.01.10.730	After John leaves, Marcus emerges from the wreckage and begins to walk towards Los Angeles.
0056_00.01.10.730-00.01.19.120	John goes to the resistance headquarters located on a nuclear submarine, where he tells General Ashdown of what he found at the base.
0056_00.01.19.120-00.01.23.440	The resistance has also learned of a kill list that the machines have to take out the command of the resistance.
0056_00.01.23.440-00.01.28.470	John is number two on the list and directly behind Kyle Reese.
0056_00.01.28.470-00.01.37.230	Most are unaware of Kyle Reese's significance, but John knows Kyle will eventually go back in time and actually be the father to John, which occurred in the first film.
0056_00.01.37.230-00.01.41.830	John also goes to see his pregnant wife, Kate, and meets with his second-in-command, Barnes.
0056_00.01.41.830-00.01.50.710	We find Marcus has made his way to the ruins of Los Angeles, where he battles a T600 Terminator and is saved by Kyle Reese.
0056_00.01.50.710-00.01.57.550	They are later attacked at a gas station, which they survived the attack, however, Marcus, Kyle, and several others are taken prisoner and placed in a transport.
0056_00.01.57.550-00.02.03.000	The transport is attacked by some resistance planes and the prisoners are able to escape and head towards John Connor's base.
0056_00.02.03.000-00.02.11.420	Marcus locates one of the pilots that was shot down, Blair Williams, and she travels back with Marcus.
0056_00.02.11.420-00.02.18.700	On the way, however, Marcus is wounded by a landmine and the resistance fighters discover that Marcus is actually a cyborg, however, Marcus believes that he is human.
0056_00.02.18.700-00.02.23.510	John believes Marcus was sent to execute him, so he orders to have Marcus killed.
0056_00.02.23.510-00.02.30.910	The pilot, Blair, helps Marcus escape during which Marcus saves John's life from Skynet's robots.
0056_00.02.30.910-00.02.37.140	John and Marcus make a deal, John will let Marcus live if Marcus will help break Kyle and the other prisoners free from Skynet's headquarters in San Francisco.
0056_00.02.37.140-00.02.44.130	Marcus enters into Skynet's headquarters, takes down their defenses, allowing John and the resistance to enter.
0056_00.02.44.130-00.02.49.480	Marcus learns that he was actually designed by Skynet's system to lure John into the base, in order to get him killed.
0056_00.02.49.480-00.02.58.290	Skynet also uses a radio signal from the resistance to track down the human command submarine, destroy it, killing the resistance leaders.
0056_00.02.58.290-00.03.09.570	Marcus removes the portion of hardware linking him to Skynet and helps John battle the new T800 Terminator robot, who looks very similar to a young Arnold Schwarzenegger, The Terminator from the first three films.
0056_00.03.09.570-00.03.17.210	Marcus is able to defeat the T800, though John is severely injured, but able to detonate explosives all around the Skynet base.
0056_00.03.17.210-00.03.25.370	John, Marcus and Kyle are airlifted out, and Marcus offers his own heart for transplant, in order to save the dying John.
0056_00.03.25.370-00.03.32.810	John later radios to the resistance fighters that though the battle has been won, the war is far from over, concluding the film.
0056_00.03.32.810-00.03.35.610	So that was the spoilers for Terminator Salvation.
0056_00.03.35.615-00.03.39.145	If you have another film you'd like to see me spoil, please let me know in the comments below.

0057_00.00.07.910-00.00.11.010	Hello and welcome to another episode of Movies Spoiler Alerts. 
0057_00.00.11.010-00.00.16.920	Today we're going to be talking about the 2015 film Terminator: Genesys, the fifth Terminator film.
0057_00.00.16.920-00.00.18.300	So let's get started.
0057_00.00.18.300-00.00.21.510	This summary relies heavily on knowledge of the previous films. 
0057_00.00.21.510-00.00.25.210	If you haven't seen them already, check out my Spoilers in the links below.
0057_00.00.30.640-00.00.41.260	The film opens in the year 2029, with the human Resistance leader John Connor launching a final attack against Skynet, the AI system set out to eliminate the human race.
0057_00.00.41.260-00.00.53.070	Just before the attack, however, Skynet uses a time machine to send back a T-800 Terminator, once again looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger, in order to kill John's mother, Sarah Connor. 
0057_00.00.53.070-00.00.58.180	John, in response, sends back Kyle Reese to travel back in time in order to save her.
0057_00.00.58.180-00.01.06.460	This is very similar to the events of the first film, as the film began with the Arnold Terminator and Kyle Reese being sent back in time. 
0057_00.01.06.460-00.01.19.010	Just as Kyle's about to leave the year 2029, Kyle sees John attacked by some type of robot, and then is sent back to the year 1984, while having visions of a childhood that he never had in the year of 2017. 
0057_00.01.19.010-00.01.26.640	In the year 1984, the scenes in this film seem to be unfolding just as they did in the first film.
0057_00.01.26.650-00.01.37.210	However, we see the T-800 is then attacked by an older T-800 and is eventually shot and defeated, which did not happen in the first film.
0057_00.01.37.210-00.01.45.110	It turns out that the T-800 that we see now was sent back in time to when Sarah was nine years old, and after her parents were killed, this T-800 Terminator has been training and prepping her for this day.
0057_00.01.45.110-00.01.55.540	Sarah is not the untrained, scared woman that we see in the first film, but now she is a confident and trained warrior, showing that this is a different past from the previous films.
0057_00.01.55.540-00.02.10.280	As this T-800 raised her, she frequently refers to him as Pa, but he is credited as the Guardian, as his primary objective is to protect Sarah Connor and ensure that she gives birth to John Connor, so one day he can lead the Resistance.
0057_00.02.10.280-00.02.20.300	Kyle arrives to 1984 shortly after, and is almost immediately attacked by a T-1000 Terminator, very similar to the model from the second film.
0057_00.02.20.300-00.02.30.180	Sarah and the Guardian rescue Kyle and the T-1000 pursues them, which they are eventually able to lead into a trap where they douse him in acid. 
0057_00.02.30.180-00.02.40.390	Sarah and the Guardian reveal that they have constructed their own time machine and plan to use it to travel to the year 1997, which is the year Skyney became self-aware in the second Terminator film.
0057_00.02.40.390-00.02.51.460	Kyle realizes, however, that the timeline has been altered because he remembers being born in a world that wasn't destroyed by machines, where his original timeline began in the apocalyptic world. 
0057_00.02.51.460-00.02.57.670	Kyle convinces Sarah to travel to the year 2017 in order to stop Skynet. 
0057_00.02.57.670-00.03.08.470	The time machine that they travel in requires that no artificial fibers or materials be present; therefore they must travel naked to the year 2017, and the Guardian will wait for their arrival and provide them with clothing.
0057_00.03.08.470-00.03.19.560	Kyle and Sarah materialize in the middle of traffic in San Francisco, which does cause a small explosion, leading to their arrest, and the Guardian is unable to make it there in time before they are apprehended.
0057_00.03.19.560-00.03.34.510	Kyle and Sarah are taken to the hospital to be treated for their wounds, and it is revealed that the new Skynet is called Genesys, which is an operating system that will interlock all forms of communication, transportation, and government, which is set to go live very soon.
0057_00.03.34.510-00.03.40.780	While still at the hospital, John Connor appears and rescues Kyle and Sarah.
0057_00.03.40.780-00.03.49.490	The Guardian arrives and begins shooting John, and it is revealed that John is no longer human, but is a hybrid T-3000 unit.
0057_00.03.49.490-00.03.56.580	It is revealed that while Kyle was sent back in time, John was attacked by a T-5000 unit, which is the physical embodiment of Skynet.
0057_00.03.56.580-00.04.07.170	It transformed John on a cellular level into the T-3000 Terminator, and John was sent back to ensure the survival of Cyberdyne Systems and the release of Genesys.
0057_00.04.07.170-00.04.16.120	Sarah, Kyle, and the Guardian are able to escape, and prepare to destroy the Genesys programming before its scheduled public release.
0057_00.04.16.120-00.04.21.430	They are chased down by John but eventually make their way to the Cyberdyne campus. 
0057_00.04.21.430-00.04.27.220	The schedule for the Genesys Project gets moved forward in order to release the program before it is destroyed.
0057_00.04.27.220-00.04.36.660	They plant explosives around the facility while the Genesys System tries to talk to them, first appearing as a young boy, but eventually appearing as the T-5000 unit that initially attacked John.
0057_00.04.36.660-00.04.44.560	John arrives and battles with the Guardian, and eventually the Guardian is able to trap John in the Cyberdine's prototype time machine.
0057_00.04.44.560-00.04.59.680	The machine is activated, and as they both have exposed inorganic materials, it causes a massive explosion, destroying John, and the Guardian is thrown into a vat of mimetic polyalloy, similar to the silver-like structure of the T-1000 unit.
0057_00.04.59.680-00.05.10.470	As the campus is exploding, Kyle and Sarah lock themselves in a bunker, sparing their lives from the explosion, knowing they have stopped Genesys from being released.
0057_00.05.10.470-00.05.16.570	The Guardian arrives, now upgraded with the mimetic poly components, and helps guide them through the debris. 
0057_00.05.16.570-00.05.30.360	They then travel to the home of Kyle's younger self so he can implant a memory and a reminder that Genesys is Skynet in order to give Kyle the memory to know to come to the year 2017 when he is older.
0057_00.05.30.360-00.05.36.530	The three then drive off into the countryside, initially seeming as though they have sucessfully defeated Genesys.
0057_00.05.36.530-00.05.50.680	However, in a scene during the credits, it is revealed that the core of Genesys was protected and survived the explosion; this should set up for the films that are planned to follow, however they aren't 100% confirmed when they will be released.
0057_00.05.50.680-00.05.54.000	So that was the Spoilers for Terminator 5: Genesys.
0057_00.05.54.000-00.05.58.210	If you have another film you'd like to see me Spoil, let me know in the comments below.

0058_00.00.08.900-00.00.12.480	Alright guys, welcome to another episode of movie spoiler alerts.
0058_00.00.12.485-00.00.15.140	In this episode, we will be spoiling the Avengers.
0058_00.00.15.140-00.00.22.550	This movie somewhat relies on that you've seen the individual character movies, but I'll do my best to explain the pertinent information.
0058_00.00.22.550-00.00.28.740	I will also be uploading summaries of all the individual characters, so check those out too if you want some more information.
0058_00.00.28.740-00.00.32.490	To get started, let's do a quick rundown of the Avengers team.
0058_00.00.32.490-00.00.42.080	Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, he's a billionaire genius that has no actual powers, but incredibly advanced technology that helps him fight bad guys.
0058_00.00.42.080-00.00.48.410	Thor, aka Pretty Boy, from Asgard, the God of Thunder, who carries a hammer that cannot be moved.
0058_00.00.48.410-00.00.56.330	Bruce Banner, aka The Hulk, a scientist that when he gets angry, becomes a massive, green creature that is nearly invincible.
0058_00.00.56.330-00.01.06.700	Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, a genetically enhanced man from the 1940's that was frozen for 70 years and is sometimes a bit out of touch with modern times.
0058_00.01.06.700-00.01.18.370	Clint Barton, aka Hawkeye, a new character to the modern Marvel movie universe, who does not have his own individual movie, and frankly no one really cares about him.
0058_00.01.18.370-00.01.23.200	Hawkeye's weapon of choice is a bow and arrow, but does not have any real specific superpowers.
0058_00.01.23.200-00.01.31.370	Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, honestly, safe for maybe Pretty Boy Thor, she's the best looking member of the Avengers.
0058_00.01.31.370-00.01.32.170	UNMATCHED:  She also does not have her own movie, but I'd definitely watch it if she did.
0058_00.01.32.170-00.01.40.900	She's a highly trained former Soviet spy, who is a master assassin and seductress.
0058_00.01.40.900-00.01.50.400	Nick Fury, while not an actual Avenger, he is the director of Shield, an organization that is sort of like a souped-up CIA that sometimes uses superheroes.
0058_00.01.50.400-00.01.57.610	The Avengers work as a part of Shield.
0058_00.01.57.610-00.01.58.910	UNMATCHED:  Now that we're explained who is part of the team, let's get to the story.
0058_00.01.58.915-00.02.01.990	The movie begins with Thor's not-so-nice brother, Loki.
0058_00.02.01.990-00.02.09.360	Loki meets a character called The Other, who is the leader of an alien race known as the Chitauri.
0058_00.02.09.360-00.02.17.740	If Loki gets an object called the tesseract from Sheild and gives it to The Other, The Other will give Loki an army capable of taking over Earth.
0058_00.02.17.740-00.02.25.770	The tesseract has been seen in quite a few other Marvel movies, especially in the first Captain America movie.
0058_00.02.25.770-00.02.26.410	UNMATCHED: I will be doing a summary of those movies explaining the history a bit more so make sure to check them out. 
0058_00.02.26.410-00.02.33.680	The tesseract is an infinity stone.
0058_00.02.33.680-00.02.34.240	UNMATCHED: For more in-depth explanation of what infinity stones are, check out my Guardians of the Galaxy movie summary.
0058_00.02.34.240-00.02.49.630	The main thing to know about the tesseract is it's a cube of great power and The Other wants it so he can give it to his master, Thanos.
0058_00.02.49.630-00.02.50.290	UNMATCHED:  Nearly all of the recent Marvel movies at least on some level have been influenced by Thanos, but we have only seen glimpses of him.
0058_00.02.50.290-00.03.00.490	Thanos is going to be playing a big role in the future and his desire to get his hands on the infinity stones is very important.

0061_00.00.26.610-00.00.33.040	Panem is divided into two primary regions: The Capitol, which is a the wealthy and ruling nation, and the districts.
0061_00.00.33.040-00.00.39.070	The districts are the poor regions, divided into twelve separate districts, based off of the resources that they provide to the Capitol.
0061_00.00.39.080-00.00.46.120	Life in the districts vary by district to district, primarily getting worse the higher the number the district, but all the districts are pretty much poorer than the Capitol. 
0061_00.00.46.120-00.00.54.150	In the history of Panem, many years ago, the districts tried to rise up against the Capitol and failed.  
0061_00.00.54.150-00.00.57.450	As punishment for the Rebellion, the Capitol instituted a yearly event known as the Hunger Games.
0061_00.00.57.450-00.01.06.030	The Hunger Games is a challenge where one boy and one girl from all twelve districts, ages twelve to eighteen, are chosen as tributes to compete in a battle to the death.
0061_00.01.06.030-00.01.14.990	Only one survivor comes out alive, and they do receive a handsome reward, but the horror of being forced into a murderous and dangerous situation typically scars the victors.
0061_00.01.14.990-00.01.18.210	These events are televised and highly publicized. 
0061_00.01.18.210-00.01.26.370	In the Capitol, they are exciting, fun games to watch; while those in the districts watch in horror as their children are murdered or killed.
0061_00.01.26.370-00.01.32.460	The film follows Katniss Everdeen, a citizen of District 12, who volunteers in place of her sister, Prim.

0061_00.01.50.540-00.01.58.290	They are also joined by their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, who is an alcoholic and a past victor of the Hunger Games. 
0061_00.01.58.290-00.02.04.570	At the Capitol, Katniss and Peeta meet the tributes from the other districts -- some who are friendly, some who are not -- and they begin their training for the Games.
0061_00.02.04.570-00.02.12.460	Katniss has a history of bow skills, having spent a great deal of time hunting with her friend and possible romantic interest, Gale.

0061_00.02.22.040-00.02.23.530	However, this relationship is not real. 
0061_00.02.23.540-00.02.35.840	The Games begin, and it becomes a series of different tributes either dying from crazy environmental conditions, insane wildlife such as giant poisonous bugs known as tracker jackers, or being killed by other tributes.
0061_00.02.35.840-00.02.42.120	Temporary alliances are made and broken, and at the end of every day, the tributes who have died are announced. 
0061_00.02.42.120-00.02.46.790	Haymitch is able to convince Crane, the Head Gamemaker, to allow there to be one male and one female victor.
0061_00.02.46.790-00.02.54.480	This would allow both Peeta and Katniss to win, which the audience wants because of their fake relationship. 
0061_00.02.54.480-00.03.01.540	Katniss and Peeta are the last remaining tributes, both having either watched people die or having killed people themselves, and now believe that they have won.
0061_00.03.01.550-00.03.06.650	However, it is announced that there will only be one winner, and Peeta and Katniss will have to fight to the death.
0061_00.03.06.650-00.03.12.790	In a desperate attempt, Katniss convinces Peeta to eat some poisonous nightlock berries with her, which would kill both of them. 
0061_00.03.12.790-00.03.22.410	She knows that this will force the Gamemakers to intervene, as there has to be a living winner, so the Gamemakers stop them and make both Katniss and Peeta the winners of the Hunger Games. 
0061_00.03.22.410-00.03.26.480	Katniss is warned that her act of defiance has gained her some enemies. 
0061_00.03.26.480-00.03.34.160	Head Gamemaker Crane is locked in a room with a bowl of nightlock berries by President Snow, presumably to kill himself as punishment for allowing two winners.
0061_00.03.34.160-00.03.42.290	Katniss and Peeta are returned back to District 12, and they try to forget the events of the Hunger Games.
0061_00.03.42.290-00.03.44.610	So that was the Spoilers for the Hunger Games.

0062_00.00.08.050-00.00.11.600	Hello and welcome to another episode of Movie Spoiler Alerts. 
0062_00.00.11.600-00.00.19.910	Today we're talking bout the 2015 film The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part 2, the fourth and final film in the Hunger Games series.
0062_00.00.19.910-00.00.21.110	So let's get started.
0062_00.00.21.110-00.00.24.610	This summary does rely in part that you've seen the previous films.
0062_00.00.24.610-00.00.27.410	If you'd like to see a summary, please check out the links below.
0062_00.00.31.030-00.00.37.450	The film picks up right where the previous film ended, with Katniss recovering after being attacked by the brainwashed Peeta.
0062_00.00.37.450-00.00.39.540	The rebels fight in District 2, disabling their weapons.  
0062_00.00.39.550-00.00.45.540	While trying to rally the troops against the Capitol, Katniss is shot and injured. 
0062_00.00.45.540-00.00.52.230	At first, the injured Katniss is told she cannot battle, but she sneaks onto a supply ship anyway.
0062_00.00.52.230-00.00.59.440	Katniss is assigned to a group including Gale, Finnick, a film crew, and a variety of other soldiers.
0062_00.00.59.450-00.01.05.370	The goal is for the group to stay behind the main wave of troops and film propaganda footage to rally even more troops.
0062_00.01.05.370-00.01.16.190	The leader of the group, Boggs, carries a holographic map called the Holo, which is supposed to help them avoid various booby traps, known as pods, which are littered throughout the Capitol.
0062_00.01.16.190-00.01.21.490	Peeta is sent to join the squad, even though he has not fully recovered from his brainwashing.
0062_00.01.21.490-00.01.30.900	As the group travels into the Capitol, they trigger various pods and several of the group members are killed, including its leader, Boggs. 
0062_00.01.30.900-00.01.38.550	Before he dies, Boggs gives Katniss the Holo in hopes that she will be able to avoid the majority of the remaining pods.
0062_00.01.38.550-00.01.52.530	Katniss convinces the surviving members that she is on a secret mission to kill Snow, and they continue to push into the Capitol, while being attacked by more pods and the Capitol's Peacekeepers, and more of the group continues to die.
0062_00.01.52.540-00.02.02.560	At one point, the Capitol believes that they are successful in killing Katniss, which they announce publicly, and President Coin delivers a eulogy in order to rally the rebels.
0062_00.02.02.560-00.02.09.660	Katniss's group travels into the sewers in hopes of avoiding some of the pods, but they are attacked by genetically engineered creatures.
0062_00.02.09.660-00.02.16.230	Some of the members of their group are killed, including Finnick, one of the previous Hunger Games winners.
0062_00.02.16.250-00.02.21.520	Katniss uses the Holo's self-destruct feature in order to take out a large portion of the creatures.
0062_00.02.21.520-00.02.32.980	Once out of the sewers, the group is pursued by more Peacekeepers, and they hide in a store owned by Tigris, a former Hunger Games stylist, who provides them shelter and disguises.
0062_00.02.32.980-00.02.42.080	President Snow offers the fleeing Capitol citizens to take refuge at his mansion, which Katniss and Gale use as an opportunity to enter the mansion.
0062_00.02.42.080-00.02.49.730	As they try to enter the mansion in disguise, the Rebels arrive and begin fighting with the Capitol Peacekeepers.
0062_00.02.49.740-00.02.57.860	A hovercraft flies overhead, dropping small parcels into an area with young children from the Capitol, which detonate, killing all of the children. 
0062_00.02.57.860-00.03.03.360	A team of Rebel medics rush in to help, including Katniss's sister, Prim.
0062_00.03.03.360-00.03.11.030	However, as the group rushes in to help, a second wave of bombs explode, killing Prim and knocking out Katniss.
0062_00.03.11.030-00.03.19.410	After Katniss recovers, she finds out that the Capitol has been taken over by the Rebels and Snow has been captured.
0062_00.03.19.410-00.03.27.620	Katniss meets with Snow, where Snow explains that the attack that killed Prim was in fact done by the Rebels and President Coin, not by the Capitol.  
0062_00.03.27.620-00.03.32.940	Katniss doubts him, but Snow reminds Katniss of an earlier promise he made not to lie to her.
0062_00.03.32.940-00.03.48.940	This scene actually relates back to a part earlier in the film, were Gale describes a similar attack of causing a small explosion to take out a small group, then a big group of people rush in, and cause a second explosion to maximize the casualties.
0062_00.03.48.940-00.03.57.500	This leads the viewers to think that the attack could possibly not be caused by the Capitol, but a vicious attack from the Rebels, which caused casualties on both sides. 
0062_00.03.57.500-00.04.01.670	This is important to consider, because remember, the entire reason Katniss got involved with the Hunger Games was to protect her sister Prim, who may have just been killed by the Rebels who she was working with.  
0062_00.04.01.670-00.04.07.720	This is important to consider, because remember, the entire reason Katniss got involved with the Hunger Games was to protect her sister Prim, who may have just been killed by the Rebels who she was working with.  
0062_00.04.07.720-00.04.17.070	Katniss approaches Gale to ask him if the attack was really orchestrated by the Rebels, and Gale is unable to assure her that it wasn't from the Rebels.
0062_00.04.17.070-00.04.21.580	Katniss then cuts off all ties with Gale, assuming that the attack really was caused by them.
0062_00.04.21.580-00.04.37.630	President Coin celebrates her victory, and has the former Hunger Games winners come to a meeting, where she proposes a new Hunger Games, where the former citizens of the Capitol must send their own children into, in order to pay for what they did to the children in the Districts.
0062_00.04.37.630-00.04.46.610	They vote on the idea, and Katniss gives the swing vote in favor, in exchange that Katniss will be able to execute Snow personally.
0062_00.04.46.620-00.04.54.330	At the public execution, instead of killing Snow, Katniss shoots and kills Coin in revenge for her sister Prim's death.
0062_00.04.54.330-00.05.00.150	The Rebels then arrest Katniss, while an angry mob kills Snow.
0062_00.05.00.150-00.05.04.570	Katniss is eventually pardoned for her crime and is returned to District 12.
0062_00.05.04.570-00.05.06.580	A new President is elected.
0062_00.05.06.590-00.05.18.660	Katniss goes on to eventually marry Peeta, as well as has two children with him, and the film ends as she reflects on the nightmares of her past, thinking on how there are much worse games to play.
0062_00.05.18.660-00.05.22.780	To add a quick point of clarification: this film doesn't really end on a happy note.
0062_00.05.22.780-00.05.33.670	Katniss lost her sister, the one who she was fighting for, and has pretty severe PTSD and trauma from the two Hunger Games she was in, as well as the Rebellion that she fought in.
0062_00.05.33.670-00.05.46.610	While some found this ending to be a bit dissatisfying, it definitely is more realistic for somebody who has participated and seen the atrocities that Katniss did, as well as having lost the main person that she was fighting for.
0062_00.05.46.610-00.05.50.710	So that was the Spoilers for the Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part 2.
0062_00.05.50.710-00.05.55.410	If you have another film you'd like to see me Spoil, please let me know in the comments below.

0063_00.00.08.050-00.00.11.310	Hello and welcome to another episode of Movie Spoiler Alerts.
0063_00.00.11.310-00.00.14.420	Today we're talking bout the 2015 film, The Martian.
0063_00.00.14.420-00.00.15.620	So let's get started.
0063_00.00.15.620-00.00.22.120	The film takes place in the year 2035, with the Ares III crew exploring the surface of Mars.
0063_00.00.22.120-00.00.28.330	A dust storm forces them to evacuate the planet and return to the orbiting vessel, Hermes.
0063_00.00.28.330-00.00.36.660	However, during the evacuation, astronaut and botanist Mark Watney is struck by some debris and lost in the storm, and is presumed dead.
0063_00.00.36.660-00.00.40.830	The rest of the crew leaves the planet, unable to search for Watney.
0063_00.00.40.830-00.00.47.400	Watney awakens after the storm due to a low oxygen warning and is able to make his way back to the base.
0063_00.00.47.400-00.00.51.290	His suit was damaged in the storm, which caused his life support readings to show him as dead.
0063_00.00.51.290-00.00.59.440	Watney realizes that he is now alone and will have to wait four years for the next NASA crew to come and find him.
0063_00.00.59.440-00.01.02.450	He also realizes the Hermes team has no idea that he is alive.
0063_00.01.02.450-00.01.15.160	Watney does some calculations and realizes that he only has enough food to last him 309 days, primarily with a diet based on potatoes, and needs to find a way to make more food in order to survive.
0063_00.01.15.160-00.01.24.670	Watney uses his skills as a botanist to find a way to make a hospital environment for the crops inside of the base, utilizing a variety of devices and clever tools.
0063_00.01.24.670-00.01.31.160	Back on Earth, after a viewing satellite photos, NASA realizes that Watney has survived. 
0063_00.01.31.160-00.01.42.080	NASA, however, decides initially to not inform Watney's crew aboard the Hermes, as they still believe that Watney died on Mars and finding out that they left him would make it so the crew is unable to complete their mission.
0063_00.01.42.080-00.01.50.830	Watney finds a way using the Pathfinder probe, which is been silent since 1997, to communicate with NASA through a very rudimentary system.
0063_00.01.50.830-00.02.00.110	Eventually Watney, through the help of NASA, is able to set up a sort of e-mail system, which he can more efficiently communicate with NASA.
0063_00.02.00.110-00.02.03.280	Watney finds out that the crew is unaware of his survival and is furious.
0063_00.02.03.280-00.02.09.360	Then NASA decides to inform the Hermes crew, and they are shocked by what they find out.
0063_00.02.09.360-00.02.14.740	NASA works quickly to build a rocket with enough food to supplement Watney until the next Mars landing.
0063_00.02.14.740-00.02.19.990	But in their haste, the ship is improperly built, and the ship explodes after takeoff.
0063_00.02.20.000-00.02.23.990	The story of Watney being trapped on Mars has now become a global affair. 
0063_00.02.23.990-00.02.31.830	The China National Space Administration offers to help NASA, giving them technology for a classified booster rocket.
0063_00.02.31.830-00.02.46.040	Through a series of events, the crew aboard the Hermes decides instead of landing back on Earth, they will use the Chinese booster to resupply the Hermes and the crew heads back to Mars, which should be an eighteen month journey.
0063_00.02.46.040-00.02.55.190	The Hermes crew plans to travel close to Mars, and Watley will use a short range vessel known as the MAV to travel off of Mars's surface in order to rendezvous with the Hermes.
0063_00.02.55.190-00.03.03.830	Watney does some serious modifications to the MAV, pretty much stripping it down to the bare bones, in order to reduce its mass to help him travel further into space.
0063_00.03.03.830-00.03.10.620	The Hermes crew remotely controls the MAV, as the extreme G-forces knock Watley unconscious as he leaves the atmosphere.
0063_00.03.10.620-00.03.19.600	When Watney awakes, he uses a nitrogen gas propelled pack to push himself away from the MAV, but still is too far away from the Hermes.
0063_00.03.19.600-00.03.25.370	He then pierces his glove of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air to thrust him closer to the Hermes.
0063_00.03.25.370-00.03.31.230	The crew intercepts him, and as NASA and the whole world listen, they rejoice upon hearing that he is safe.
0063_00.03.31.230-00.03.41.830	The film ends showing the crew several years later in their new lives, with Watney returning to be a survival instructor, training new astronaut candidates.
0063_00.03.41.830-00.03.44.000	So that was the Spoilers for The Martian.
0063_00.03.44.000-00.03.47.810	If you have another film you'd like to see me spoil, please let me know in the comments below.

0064_00.00.08.050-00.00.11.400	Hello and welcome to another episode of Movie Spoiler Alerts.
0064_00.00.11.400-00.00.15.020	Today we're talking about the 2014 film, The Maze Runner.
0064_00.00.15.020-00.00.16.410	So let's get started.
0064_00.00.16.410-00.00.24.290	The film opens with a teenage male named Thomas being lifted up from an underground elevator with no memory of his past, except for his name.
0064_00.00.24.290-00.00.35.250	When he reaches the surface he finds himself on a glade, where he meets a group of teenage boys known as the Gladers, who also have no memories except for their own names.
0064_00.00.35.250-00.00.43.450	The Glade has developed into a society structured by various labor activities, from growing food, medicine, and another group known as Runners.
0064_00.00.43.450-00.00.49.700	Thomas discovers that the Glade is surrounded by a labyrinth of high walls referred to as the Maze. 
0064_00.00.49.700-00.00.58.390	Every morning the Maze opens and the Runners try to solve the Maze before nightfall happens, where the entrances from the Glade into the Maze close.
0064_00.00.58.390-00.01.03.200	At night, in the closed Maze, dangerous mechanical spider-creatures roam the Maze.
0064_00.01.03.200-00.01.08.550	No one has ever survived a night in the Maze, which is why the Runners return before nightfall.
0064_00.01.08.550-00.01.16.660	The maze is also ever-changing, with multiple different combinations, so the Runners must become aware of the different variations.
0064_00.01.16.660-00.01.24.060	Shortly after Thomas's arrival, a girl arrives on the elevator to the Glade, the first girl ever to be brought to the Glade.
0064_00.01.24.060-00.01.27.740	Shortly after arriving, she appears to recognize Thomas and falls into a coma.
0064_00.01.27.740-00.01.34.870	The other members of the Glade ask Thomas if he remembers her, and he has an unclear flashback, realizing he does know her.
0064_00.01.34.870-00.01.37.450	It is later revealed that her name is Teresa.
0064_00.01.37.450-00.01.47.820	Teresa's arrival is pretty significant, however, as she arrives with a note saying "She's the last one ever", implying that no more people or supplies will be brought to the Glade.
0064_00.01.47.830-00.01.57.330	On top of that, the doors to the Glade into the Maze now stay open at night, allowing the robot spiders known as Grievers, to enter into the Glade and attack the Gladers.
0064_00.01.57.330-00.02.08.810	A large portion of the Gladers decide to make a run for it into the Maze, using some of the technology from a destroyed Griever to enter into a secret passageway that leads into an observatory lab.
0064_00.02.08.810-00.02.20.240	They discover that the whole maze was actually some form of experiment created by an organization called World In Catastrophe: Killzone Experiment Department, a.k.a. WICKED.
0064_00.02.20.250-00.02.32.480	However, their reason for placing the Gladers into this experiment is not exactly clear, though it seems to be related to a near-apocalyptic outside world, caused by an event known as the Flare, which killed off half of the world's population.
0064_00.02.32.480-00.02.41.650	It appears as though that the lab was destroyed and a large portion of the scientists and operators who were monitoring the Gladers were killed by a rebel group.
0064_00.02.41.650-00.02.49.480	One of the Gladers, Gally, who never really trusted Thomas, arrives to the lab and tries to kill Thomas.
0064_00.02.49.480-00.02.51.870	Another Glader jumps in front of the knife and sacrifices his life.
0064_00.02.51.870-00.02.59.490	The Gladers are suddenly rescued by armed rebels and are flown in helicopters to a supposed safe haven.
0064_00.02.59.490-00.03.12.230	However, in the films epilogue, it appears that the rebel group actually may be part of the experiment, and that they are only taking the Gladers to the next trial to continue testing them, and that the Gladers are not the only group being tested.
0064_00.03.12.230-00.03.14.610	So that was the spoilers for The Maze Runner.
0064_00.03.14.610-00.03.18.410	If you have another film you'd like to see me Spoil, please let me know in the comments below.

0065_00.00.08.100-00.00.11.120	Hello and welcome to another episode of movie spoiler alerts.
0065_00.00.11.120-00.00.14.510	Today we're talking about the 1984 film, The Terminator.
0065_00.00.14.510-00.00.15.840	So let's get started.
0065_00.00.15.845-00.00.21.410	The film is based on the premise that in the future, robots will take over the world and try to eradicate mankind.
0065_00.00.21.410-00.00.28.490	The majority of the film is set in Los Angeles in the year 1984 where 2 beings have just arrived from the future.
0065_00.00.28.490-00.00.32.830	One is a Terminator T800, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
0065_00.00.32.830-00.00.40.690	Terminators are a type of robot with many different versions, designed to kill humans in the future.
0065_00.00.40.690-00.00.47.040	This Terminator was sent back to kill Sarah Connor, because in the future, she will give birth to a son who will be the leader of the human resistance against the machines.
0065_00.00.47.040-00.00.53.740	The other being that has arrived is Kyle Reese, a human resistance member who was sent to protect Sarah Connor.
0065_00.00.53.740-00.01.01.310	The Terminator begins to attack and kill every woman named Sarah Connor, as he does not know exactly what the real Sarah Connor looks like.
0065_00.01.01.310-00.01.15.390	Kyle Reese is able to locate the real Sarah Connor using a picture he was given, and tells her that there is a defense network, known as Skynet, that will eventually become self-aware and start a nuclear holocaust, wiping out a large portion of the human race.
0065_00.01.15.390-00.01.24.940	The humans were nearing victory against the machines in the future, so the robots sent the Terminator to kill Sarah Connor so her future son, John Connor, would never be able to lead the resistance.
0065_00.01.24.940-00.01.33.120	Initially, Sarah does not believe Kyle, but after the Terminator attacks and they escape a few times, she starts to believe.
0065_00.01.33.120-00.01.37.640	At some point, the 2 devevlop a romantic connection and have sex with one another.
0065_00.01.37.640-00.01.45.830	The Terminator finds them again and they go into a factory where the final battle begins.

0065_00.02.06.120-00.02.13.190	She has been recording audio tapes for her unborn son, John, and has a picture taken, the same picture that Kyle had at the beginning of the film.

0066_00.01.03.630-00.01.08.650	Malekith, awakened by the Aether's release, attacks Asgard.
0066_00.01.08.650-00.01.13.410	Thor's mother, Frigga, is killed protecting Jane and the dark elves flee.
0066_00.01.13.410-00.01.15.880	Thor enlists the help of Loki to use a portal to confront Malekith.
0066_00.01.15.880-00.01.20.500	As Malekith draws the Aether out of Jane, Thor attempts to destroy it, but fails.
0066_00.01.20.505-00.01.24.060	Malekith emerges with the Aether and leaves.

0067_00.00.11.510-00.00.15.610	Today we're talking about the 2016 film, X-Men Apocalypse.
0067_00.00.15.610-00.00.22.840	As stated in my other summaries, X-Men has a non-linear storyline, with many things being ret conned out by Fox.
0067_00.00.22.840-00.00.29.700	I will most likely do a podcast discussing my interpretations of the story line and how it varies from the official timeline.
0067_00.00.29.700-00.00.32.990	This summary does rely in part that you've seen the previous films.
0067_00.00.32.995-00.00.38.165	If you'd like to see a summary, check out the links below, as well as the summaries for the other Marvel films.
0067_00.00.38.210-00.00.46.540	The film opens showing a powerful mutant known as En Sabah Nur, or Apocalypse, being trapped inside of a tomb in ancient Egypt.
0067_00.00.46.540-00.00.54.490	Apocalypse is thought to be one of the first mutants with a wide variety of powers, including the ability to channel and upgrade other mutants' powers.
0067_00.00.54.490-00.01.02.440	Apocalypse wakes up in the year 1983 and he believes that humanity has lost its way and that the world needs to be cleansed of humanity and remade.
0067_00.01.02.440-00.01.12.530	He recruits a young Storm, who can control the weather, and upgrades her powers, making her one of his lieutenants, which in the comic books this is referred to one of his 4 horsemen.
0067_00.01.12.530-00.01.21.200	The film transitions into showing a young Mystique rescuing several mutants, including the winged mutant, Angel, and the teleporter, Night Crawler.
0067_00.01.21.200-00.01.26.820	Night Crawler and Mystique travel to Xavier's school, while Angel and another mutant named Psylocke are recruited by Apocalypse.
0067_00.01.26.820-00.01.30.780	Both of their powers are enhanced and they become Apocalypse's lieutenants.
0067_00.01.30.780-00.01.40.370	We see a young Scott Summers, or Cyclops, develop his powers, come to Xavier's school and eventually meet the telepathic and telekinetic Jean Grey.
0067_00.01.40.370-00.01.51.450	Apocalypse's activites have caught the attention of the X-Men and Xavier consults with CIA agent, Moira MacTaggert, who has been researching the legend of Apocalypse.
0067_00.01.51.450-00.01.55.540	This is also the same MacTaggert from the first class film, that Xavier had a love interest with.
0067_00.01.55.540-00.02.03.040	The film transitions to Magneto, who is in hiding with his wife and daughter, who are all discovered and his family is killed.

0067_00.02.14.040-00.02.22.450	Apocalypse gains control of Xavier and Cerebro and forces all the world's nukes to be fired into space so they can't be used against Apocalypse.
0067_00.02.22.450-00.02.33.200	Xavier is kidnapped, the Xavier mansion is destroyed, but all of its residents are saved by the speedster, Quicksilver, who is actually Magneto's son.
0067_00.02.33.200-00.02.41.330	Some of the students are captured by a younger Colonel Stryker, the same Colonel Stryker that is seen in the X2 and the X-Men Origins films.
0067_00.02.41.330-00.02.50.160	The captured mutants eventually break out with the help of a brainwashed Wolverine, aka Weapon X, who at this point in the timeline, is unaware of who the X-Men are.
0067_00.02.50.160-00.02.54.410	Jean restores a portion of Wolverine's memory and he flees.
0067_00.02.54.410-00.03.02.870	Magneto begins to use his powers to control the Earth's magnetic poles, causing massive destruction and death across the entire planet.
0067_00.03.02.870-00.03.12.870	Apocalypse attempts to steal Xavier's body so he can gain his telepathic powers, but Xavier is able to send a distress call to Jean and the other students and is saved before his powers are stolen.

0067_00.03.48.110-00.03.56.830	In a post-credits scene, we see men from the Essex Corporation retrieving the data from Stryker's facility, including a blood sample from Weapon X.
0067_00.03.56.830-00.04.03.700	This is a reference to Mr. Sinister, an X-Men villian and probably will play some part in future X-Men films.
0067_00.04.03.700-00.04.11.730	One last thing that I wanted to point out is that the film sort of makes Magneto out as an ok-ish guy by the end of the film after he turns on Apocalypse.
0067_00.04.11.730-00.04.15.730	My issue with this is the devastation we see in the film.
0067_00.04.15.730-00.04.19.790	It's reasonable to say literally hundreds of millions of people died because of what Apocalypse and Magneto did.
0067_00.04.19.790-00.04.25.020	Cairo was completely destroyed, which has a population of well over 10 million people.
0067_00.04.25.020-00.04.26.330	UNMATCHED:  I don't normally put my opinion in these spoilers, but it really bothered me that everyone seems kind of ok with Magneto by the end of the film, where he played a crucial part in killing a minimum of 100 million people
0067_00.04.26.330-00.04.36.560	UNMATCHED
0067_00.04.36.560-00.04.37.380	UNMATCHED:  This is something that often is ignored in superhero films, except for maybe Civil War and is extremely frustrating to me.
0067_00.04.37.380-00.04.42.330	UNMATCHED
0067_00.04.42.330-00.04.44.480	UNMATCHED:  I just thought I'd share my 2 cents about that.
0067_00.04.44.485-00.04.46.930	So that was the spoilers for X-Men Apocalypse.
0067_00.04.46.930-00.04.50.190	If you have a film you'd like to see me spoil, please let me know in the comments below.

0068_00.00.24.290-00.00.33.480	The film opens in 1944 German-occupied Poland, with 13 year old Eric Lehnsherr, who is separated from his parents at a concentration camp.

0068_00.00.40.320-00.00.45.410	Decades later, we find a world where mutants are just beginning to be discovered.
0068_00.00.45.410-00.00.49.660	Mutants are humans with genetic evolutions that allow them a variety of superpowers.

0068_00.02.44.080-00.02.49.790	As the X-Men leave to go find Rogue, Mystique sabotages the Cerebro machine.
0068_00.02.49.790-00.02.56.860	At the train station, Wolverine tries to convince Rogue to stay, but a fight ensues with Magneto, Toad and Sabretooth.

0068_00.03.00.540-00.03.09.240	Back at the school Senator Kelly arrives to reveal to Xavier what happened to him, and died shortly after, turning into a puddle of water.
0068_00.03.09.240-00.03.16.900	The X-Men realize that Magneto wants to use his artificial mutation machine on a much larger scale and affect thousands of people at a World Leaders Summit.
0068_00.03.16.900-00.03.29.240	The problem is that Magneto nearly died using his machine when he was testing it the first time, so he plans to use Rogue after copying his abilities to trigger the machine, killing Rogue instead of killing Magneto.
0068_00.03.29.240-00.03.36.200	Xavier attempts to locate Rogue using Cerebro, but Mystique's sabotage causes him to fall into a coma.

0071_00.01.09.005-00.01.11.155	UNMATCHED

0071_00.01.27.150-00.01.33.830	Other mutants, however, are horrified by the idea that they are curing mutation, and Magneto is especially upset.

0072_00.04.11.995-00.04.16.070	Erik rushes to Xavier's aid, and while distracted, the missiles fall harmlessly into the ocean.
0072_00.04.16.070-00.04.23.830	Erik then leaves, taking several of the mutants with him, leaving due to his and Xavier's different views on mutants and humans.
0072_00.04.23.830-00.04.28.450	As the film concludes, Xavier opens a school inside of his mansion for mutants.

0073_00.00.08.030-00.00.11.770	Hello and welcome to another episode of movie spoiler alerts.
0073_00.00.11.775-00.00.16.270	Today, we're talking about the 2009 film, X-Men Origins, Wolverine.
0073_00.00.16.270-00.00.21.740	This was the fourth X-Men film to come out from Fox, however, many more came after.
0073_00.00.21.740-00.00.28.440	Depending on how you look at it, timeline wise, this film is one of the films that is set at the earliest time points.
0073_00.00.28.440-00.00.39.030	Two quick points that I wanted to make: The first is that there are two X-Men films with very similar names, X-Men Origins, Wolverine, which we will be discussing now, and the Wolverine.
0073_00.00.39.030-00.00.46.540	One is an origin story, another is a film that is set after the events of the third film, X-Men, The Last Stand.
0073_00.00.46.540-00.00.53.870	The other point that I wanted to make, which I didn't explain in the earlier film summaries, is that there are two main timelines in the film series.
0073_00.00.53.870-00.01.03.830	I will explain this more for the summary for X-Men, Days of Future Past, but I wanted to include a nice graphic from Raymond Low in the description if you want to take a sneak peak.
0073_00.01.03.830-00.01.07.230	The summary does rely in part that you've seen the previous films.
0073_00.01.07.235-00.01.12.810	If you'd like to see a summary, check out the links below, as well as the summaries for the other Marvel films.
0073_00.01.12.810-00.01.22.330	The film opens in 1845, with a boy names James Howlett, living in Canada, who witnesses his father killed by Thomas Logan.
0073_00.01.22.330-00.01.32.290	The trauma activates the boy's mutation, causing bone claws to protrude from his knuckles and the boy kills Thomas, who reveals to James that Thomas is actually his real father.
0073_00.01.32.290-00.01.40.160	James flees along with Thomas's son, Victor Creed, who is James's half-brother and later on will become Sabretooth.
0073_00.01.40.160-00.01.51.080	They both have prolonged life cycles, spending the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American War, both World Wars and Vietnam.
0073_00.01.51.080-00.01.56.450	During the Vietnam War, Victor tries to rape a Vietnamese woman and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him.
0073_00.01.56.450-00.02.02.680	James defends Victor and both are sentenced to death via firing squad, however, they both survive.
0073_00.02.02.680-00.02.10.080	The two are approached by Major William Stryker, who asks if they want to join a military mutant group, called Team X.
0073_00.02.10.080-00.02.16.040	Remember, Stryker is one of the main antagonists of the X2 film, which if you need a reminder, please check out my summary.
0073_00.02.16.040-00.02.25.660	They joined the group, but James, now going by the name Logan, leaves the group because of their disregard for human life, especially seen with his brother, Victor.
0073_00.02.25.660-00.02.31.080	Six years later, Logan is working as a lumberjack in Canada, where he lives with his girlfriend, Kayla.
0073_00.02.31.080-00.02.37.620	Stryker approaches Logan, saying that two other members of Team X have been killed, and he thinks someone is targeting the team members.
0073_00.02.37.620-00.02.45.910	Logan refuses to help, but soon, Logan finds his girlfriend's bloody body, knowing that this was Victor's doing.
0073_00.02.45.910-00.02.49.370	Logan finds Victor, but loses the fight.
0073_00.02.49.370-00.02.56.610	Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue and offers to help Logan to become strong enough to fight Victor.
0073_00.02.56.610-00.03.03.860	Logan goes through an incredibly painful procedure and has his skeleton reinforced with adamantium, a virtually indestructable metal.
0073_00.03.03.860-00.03.10.830	Stryker, however, tries to betray Logan, ordering his memory to be erased, which Logan overhears and escapes.
0073_00.03.10.830-00.03.14.950	A member of Team X, Agent Zero, tracks down Logan, but Logan kills him.
0073_00.03.14.950-00.03.27.700	Logan locates two other former members of Team X, who explain that Victor is actually working for Stryker and is hunting down mutants for an experiment at Stryker's labratory, called The Island.
0073_00.03.27.700-00.03.31.680	They refer Logan to a mutant who escaped The Island, Gambit, in order to find the location of The Island.
0073_00.03.31.680-00.03.41.870	Logan finds Gambit, and fights with Victor again, who kills one of the Team X members and extracts his DNA.
0073_00.03.41.870-00.03.46.330	Logan and Gambit travel to the lab which is located on Three Mile Island.
0073_00.03.46.330-00.03.55.080	Logan soon discovers that his girlfriend, Kayla, is actually alive and was keeping tabs on him for Stryker in exchange for protection for her sister's life.
0073_00.03.55.080-00.04.01.700	Kayla is actually also a mutant with several abilities, including the ability to control anyone she touches.
0073_00.04.01.700-00.04.16.930	Stryker activates his experiment, which is a mutant that he made from a combination of DNA from other mutants, putting them into Wade Wilson, calling him Weapon 11, which he also refers to as the Deadpool, because he is a combination of other dead mutants.
0073_00.04.16.930-00.04.26.280	It should be noted that this Deadpool is in many ways drastically different than the Deadpool we see in the 2016 film, though they are both played by Ryan Reynolds.
0073_00.04.26.285-00.04.30.520	This Deadpool has a variety of powers and is nearly unstoppable.
0073_00.04.30.520-00.04.39.570	Logan and Victor team up and eventually Logan is able to decapitate Deadpool, but one of the cooling towers is destroyed in the process.
0073_00.04.39.570-00.04.49.490	Kayla leads the captive mutants off the island, including a young Scott Summers, aka Cyclops, and then they are eventually rescued by Professor Xavier.
0073_00.04.49.490-00.04.55.740	Stryker shoots Logan in the head with an adamantium bullet, rendering him unconscious.
0073_00.04.55.740-00.05.01.690	Stryker then turns the gun on Kayla, but she is able to use her abilities to persuade Stryker to walk until his feet bleed.
0073_00.05.01.690-00.05.05.080	Kayla was injured earlier, however, and succumbs to her wounds and dies.
0073_00.05.05.080-00.05.09.040	Logan regains his consciousness, but has lost all of his memories.
0073_00.05.09.040-00.05.14.390	He sees Kayla's body, but does not recognize her, and leaves the island as the film ends.
0073_00.05.14.390-00.05.25.470	During the mid-credit scene, we see Stryker being questioned for the death of his superior officer, who he in fact was involved with the killing of.
0073_00.05.25.470-00.05.29.850	There also was a post-credit scene which showed Deadpool's head still moving, implying that he is still alive.
0073_00.05.29.855-00.05.33.265	So that was the spoilers for X-Men Origins, Wolverine.
0073_00.05.33.265-00.05.37.215	If you have another film you'd like to see me spoil, please let me know in the comments below.

0074_00.02.24.540-00.02.33.070	Stryker has his son control Xavier to begin to use the second Cerebro to find and try to kill all of the mutants.

0082_00.00.16.160-00.00.25.980	The experiment, part of a World War II-era super soldier program that Ross helps to recreate, fails and the exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the Hulk for brief periods of time whenever his heart rate rises above 200.

0082_00.00.31.050-00.00.36.430	Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross in particular, who wants to weaponize the Hulk process.

0082_00.01.10.480-00.01.13.690	Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team.
0082_00.01.13.690-00.01.24.930	After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees to be injected with a small amount of a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impair his judgement.
0082_00.01.24.930-00.01.30.290	Banner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty, who is dating psychiatrist Leonard Samson.
0082_00.01.30.290-00.01.37.160	Banner is attacked by Ross and Blonsky's forces, tipped off by the suspicious Samson, causing him to again transform  into the Hulk.
0082_00.01.37.160-00.01.44.150	The ensuing battle outside the university proves to be futile for Ross's forces and they eventually retreat, though Blonsky, whose sanity is starting to falter, boldly attacks and mocks the Hulk.
0082_00.01.44.160-00.01.49.760	The Hulk seemingly kills Blonsky and flees with Betty.
0082_00.01.49.760-00.01.54.280	After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City.
0082_00.01.54.280-00.02.01.630	Mr. Blue is actually cellular biologist Dr. Samuel Sterns, who tells Banner he has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition.
0082_00.02.01.640-00.02.07.420	After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation.
0082_00.02.07.420-00.02.15.920	Sterns reveals he has synthesized Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply with the intention of applying its limitless potential to medicine.
0082_00.02.15.920-00.02.20.510	Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply.
0082_00.02.20.510-00.02.23.070	Meanwhile, Blonsky is revealed to have survived the battle and has completely healed.
0082_00.02.23.070-00.02.27.560	He joins Ross's forces for a third attempt to take Banner into custody.
0082_00.02.27.560-00.02.31.070	They succeed, and Banner along with Betty are taken away in a helicopter.
0082_00.02.31.070-00.02.37.750	Blonsky stays behind and forces Sterns to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power.
0082_00.02.37.750-00.02.44.160	Stern warns the combination of the super-soldier formula and Banner's blood may cause him to become an "abomination", but Blonsky insists.
0082_00.02.44.160-00.02.49.190	The experiment mutates Blonsky into a creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk, but drives him mad.
0082_00.02.49.190-00.02.55.690	He attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood in the cut on his forehead, causing him to begin mutating as well.
0082_00.02.55.690-00.02.59.180	Blonsky then rampages through Harlem.
0082_00.02.59.180-00.03.01.950	Realizing the Hulk is the only one who can stop Blonsky, Banner convinces Ross to release him.
0082_00.03.01.950-00.03.10.709	He jumps from Ross's helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground.
0082_00.03.10.709-00.03.15.250	After a long and brutal battle through Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky.
0082_00.03.15.250-00.03.19.760	After having a small, peaceful moment with Betty, the Hulk flees from New York.
0082_00.03.19.760-00.03.21.120	A month later, Banner is in Bella Coola, British Columbia.
0082_00.03.21.130-00.03.26.330	Instead of trying to suppress his transformation, he successfully transforms in a controlled manner.
0082_00.03.26.330-00.03.42.240	In a final scene, Tony Stark approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him a team, "the Avengers", is being put together.
0083_00.00.00.020-00.00.09.830	In 965 A.D., Odin, King of Asgard, wages war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim and their leader, Laufey, to prevent them from conquering the nine realms, starting with Earth.

0083_00.00.39.740-00.00.50.430	For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer, Mjolnir, now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.

0083_00.01.52.260-00.01.56.790	The warriors find Thor, but The Destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead.
0083_00.01.56.790-00.02.02.790	Struck by The Destroyer and near death, Thor's sacrifice proves him worthy to wield Mjolnir.
0083_00.02.02.790-00.02.07.030	The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat The Destroyer.
0083_00.02.07.030-00.02.12.350	Kissing Jane goodbye and vowing to return, he and his fellow Asgardians leave to confront Loki.
0083_00.02.12.350-00.02.22.990	Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifrost bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father.
0083_00.02.22.990-00.02.29.690	Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifrost bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard.
0083_00.02.29.690-00.02.39.790	Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki allows himself to fall when Odin rejects his plays for approval.
0083_00.02.39.790-00.02.46.670	Thor makes amends with Odin and admitting he is not ready to be king, while on Earth, Jane and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.
0083_00.02.46.670-00.02.57.220	In a post-credits scene, Selvig has been taken to a Shield facility, where Nick Fury opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube shaped object, which Fury says may hold untold power.
0083_00.02.57.220-00.03.01.270	An invisible Loki prompts Selvig to agree and he does.
0084_00.00.00.010-00.00.01.600	Boil Down Cinema.
0084_00.00.01.600-00.00.02.700	Jurassic Park
0084_00.00.02.700-00.00.04.030	Let's get cracking.
0084_00.00.04.030-00.00.07.030	This is crazy billionaire John Hammond.
0084_00.00.07.030-00.00.12.950	He's managed to take prehistoric DNA from mosquitoes, mix it with frog juice, and create a theme park full of dinosaurs.
0084_00.00.12.950-00.00.15.750	However, while building the park there have been some accidents, like this guy getting eaten.
0084_00.00.15.750-00.00.17.460	Goodbye, "this guy".
0084_00.00.17.460-00.00.21.790	So his lawyer insisted he bring some experts to the park to prove it's safe before being open to the public.
0084_00.00.21.790-00.00.29.400	He gathers Ian Malcolm in black, a chaotician; Ellie Sattler in pink, a paleobotanist; and Dr. Alan Grant in blue, the best paleontologist around.
0084_00.00.29.400-00.00.31.690	Plus that's his lawyer with the hairy knees, Gennaro.
0084_00.00.31.700-00.00.34.680	So they arrive at the park and Dr. Wu tells them what is going on.
0084_00.00.34.680-00.00.36.610	Ian Malcolm cannot get his head around all this.
0084_00.00.36.610-00.00.38.400	He's like, "You can't control these animals.
0084_00.00.38.400-00.00.41.300	Life... ah, ah... finds a way."
0084_00.00.41.300-00.00.45.920	Meanwhile Grant's busy staring at this baby dinosaur and he's like, "What species is this?"
0084_00.00.45.920-00.00.47.750	And Wu's like, "It's a Raptor".
0084_00.00.47.750-00.00.50.110	And Grant's like, "You bred Raptors?"
0084_00.00.50.110-00.00.53.150	And Wu's like, "Yeah.  Yeah, we did."
0084_00.00.53.150-00.00.55.700	Surprise -- here come Hammond's grandkids, Lex and Tim.
0084_00.00.55.700-00.00.58.120	They're coming along to make sure the park is fun for kids.
0084_00.00.58.120-00.01.03.750	And Grant's just looking on in horror and he's like, "I hate kids.  I fucking hate kids."
0084_00.01.03.750-00.01.06.870	So they jump in these awesome self-driving Land Cruisers and head out to the park.
0084_00.01.06.870-00.01.11.980	In the control room, watching on, we've got Hammond, Mr. Arnold, Muldoon and Nedry.
0084_00.01.11.980-00.01.16.390	And get this: Nedry's got this secret plan to steal some embryos for a rival firm, and he's just waiting for the right time to strike.
0084_00.01.16.390-00.01.20.220	Back at the car, the guys see a sick Triceratops and just jump out and have a look.
0084_00.01.20.220-00.01.24.140	And the guys in the control room are obviously not happy, because the guests are now taking the complete piss.
0084_00.01.24.140-00.01.28.390	So they're like, "Fuck it.  Okay, there's a storm coming anyway.  Get them back here and we'll try again tomorrow."
0084_00.01.28.390-00.01.29.470	This is when Nedry makes his move.
0084_00.01.29.470-00.01.33.180	He turns off the security systems, steals the embryos, and heads out for the dock.
0084_00.01.33.180-00.01.38.570	On the way, he accidentally bumps into a Dilophosaurus, gets green shit spat in his face, and dies.
0084_00.01.38.570-00.01.39.200	So now all hell is going to break loose.
0084_00.01.39.200-00.01.40.150	The fences are out.
0084_00.01.40.150-00.01.43.220	The cars have come to a stop outside the T-rex enclosure.
0084_00.01.43.220-00.01.44.910	Tim's like, "Do you feel that?"
0084_00.01.44.910-00.01.46.360	The water starts rippling.
0084_00.01.46.360-00.01.47.470	The T-rex approaches.
0084_00.01.47.470-00.01.50.620	The lawyer shits it, and runs away to the toilet and hides.
0084_00.01.50.620-00.01.53.200	T-rex breaks through the fences -- best scene of the movie.
0084_00.01.53.210-00.02.00.070	Now this is when Grant's hatred of kids is vindicated, because they just make a couple of really, really bad decisions.
0084_00.02.00.070-00.02.04.270	Lex starts shining a torch directly at the T-rex, and then Tim slams the door in its face.
0084_00.02.04.270-00.02.06.790	So Rex fucks up the car completely and tips it on its roof.
0084_00.02.06.790-00.02.08.400	This is Grant's hero moment.
0084_00.02.08.400-00.02.10.910	He lights a flare, gets out of the car, and throws it aside.
0084_00.02.10.910-00.02.14.090	But he stays still because he knows T-rex's vision is based on movement.
0084_00.02.14.090-00.02.16.010	Then Malcolm gets out to try and help as well.
0084_00.02.16.010-00.02.18.750	Grant's like, "Ian, freeze!"
0084_00.02.18.750-00.02.23.480	But Malcolm, for some reason, just starts running and he's like, "Get the kids!"
0084_00.02.23.480-00.02.27.630	T-rex chases him, sends him flying, and smashes into the toilet, where he finds the lawyer, and he just eats him to death.
0084_00.02.27.630-00.02.31.460	Grant tries to help the kids, but T-rex is like, "Fuck this noise" and just barges them over the cliff.
0084_00.02.31.470-00.02.34.690	Ellie and Muldoon come out to try and find them, but they're already gone and lost in the park by now.
0084_00.02.34.700-00.02.36.950	They pick up Malcolm and are chased away by the T-rex.
0084_00.02.36.950-00.02.45.910	Grant's [unintelligible] look after these kids with this crazy situation, and they find some eggs, and Grant works out that this must mean that the dinosaurs can actually breed, despite Wu earlier on telling them that they're all female.
0084_00.02.45.910-00.02.48.450	Something to do with frog DNA, meaning you can change sex.
0084_00.02.48.450-00.02.50.190	Anyway, "life found a way".
0084_00.02.50.190-00.02.53.690	So Goldblum's got his chest out and Mr. Arnold went to try and reboot the system, but disappeared.
0084_00.02.53.700-00.02.59.830	Muldoon and Ellie then go and try and find him, but Muldoon's like, "Ah, shit.  We're being hunted, mate.  You go ahead and I'll sort these out."
0084_00.02.59.830-00.03.03.060	He aims for one Raptor, but then the other one comes and kills him from the side.
0084_00.03.03.060-00.03.04.620	"Clever girl."
0084_00.03.04.620-00.03.08.550	Ellie manages to find the control panel and turns everything back on, but gets attacked by a Raptor in the process.
0084_00.03.08.550-00.03.13.190	She bumps into Mr. Arnold's severed arm and she's just like, "For God's sake," and gets the hell out of there.
0084_00.03.13.190-00.03.15.200	Meanwhile, Grant just drops the kids back up at the Visitor's Center.
0084_00.03.15.200-00.03.15.960	They'll be fine.
0084_00.03.15.960-00.03.16.970	Raptors show up.
0084_00.03.16.970-00.03.18.310	The kids have to hide in the kitchen.
0084_00.03.18.310-00.03.22.190	It's super tense, but somehow they manage to lock one in a fridge and get out to find Grant and Ellie.
0084_00.03.22.190-00.03.26.300	Lex manages to turn the security systems back on, meaning that Hammond can call the mainland for a chopper.
0084_00.03.26.300-00.03.34.700	The group then find themselves in the lobby of the Visitor's Center, surrounded by Raptors and certain death until -- da-da-da -- T-rex comes back and eats the Raptors, leaving the humans free to sneak out.
0084_00.03.34.710-00.03.36.900	Raptors dead, T-Rex roars, amazing.
0084_00.03.36.900-00.03.39.710	The guys then run outside and hop into a jeep with Hammond and Malcolm.
0084_00.03.39.710-00.03.44.790	Grant's like, "Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your park!" and Hammond's like, "Yeah, no shit."
0084_00.03.44.790-00.03.46.710	They get back to the helipad and take off.
0084_00.03.46.710-00.03.49.090	Credits roll.
0084_00.03.49.090-00.03.51.700	Five-word summary: Man can't control cloned dinosaurs.
0084_00.03.51.700-00.03.52.600	That's it, guys.
0084_00.03.52.600-00.03.53.400	Thanks for watching.

0085_00.00.08.230-00.00.11.570	Hello and welcome to another episode of movie spoiler alerts.
0085_00.00.11.575-00.00.16.620	Today we're tlaking about the 1982 science fiction classic, Blade Runner.
0085_00.00.16.620-00.00.17.900	So let's get started.
0085_00.00.17.900-00.00.28.570	An important thing to note about this film is that it had several different releases, but we're gonna focus on the 2007 final cut, as this is the one that is seen as canon for the upcoming Blade Runner 2049.
0085_00.00.28.570-00.00.39.450	The film begins in Los Angeles in 2019, where ex-cop Rick Deckard is being detained by Officer Gaff and is brought before his former supervisor, Harry Bryant.
0085_00.00.39.450-00.00.47.700	Deckard used to work as a Blade Runner, which involved tracking down biologically engineered beings, known as replicants, and would retire, aka kill the robots.
0085_00.00.47.700-00.00.58.200	Deckard is asked to come back to the job to track down four replicants that have came to Earth illegally in order to extend their lifespans, which is supposed to be just for four years.
0085_00.00.58.200-00.01.10.280	Deckard watches a video of another Blade Runner giving a replicant a Voight-Kampff test, which is used to determine if the subject is a human or a replicant based off their emotional responses.
0085_00.01.10.280-00.01.13.830	The subject, Leon, shoots and kills the Blade Runner after being asked about his mother.
0085_00.01.13.830-00.01.22.290	Leon, along with three other replicants, Roy Batty, Zhora and Pris are targets Deckard is asked to retire.
0085_00.01.22.290-00.01.24.910	Deckard eventually agrees to pursue the replicants.
0085_00.01.24.910-00.01.33.200	Deckard begins investigating the Tyrell corporation, the company that made the Nexus 6 models, the version of the replicants that his targets are.
0085_00.01.33.200-00.01.44.490	He wants to know if they test will work on the newer models, and meets Dr. Eldon Tyrell, the initial creator of the replicants, and his assistant, Rachael, an experimental replicant who believes she's actually human.
0085_00.01.44.490-00.01.50.370	She has been given false memories for a more real emotional response, making testing very difficult.
0085_00.01.50.370-00.01.56.930	While Deckard is pursuing the replicants, the replicants are searching for Dr. Tyrell in order to extend their lifespans.
0085_00.01.56.930-00.02.06.160	Roy and Leon investigate a replicant manufacturing lab and learn of a genetic designer, J.F. Sebastian, who works with Dr. Tyrell.
0085_00.02.06.160-00.02.10.740	Eventually, Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him into siding with her.
0085_00.02.10.740-00.02.23.700	Meanwhile, Rachael visits with Deckard at his apartment to prove that she is human by showing him a family photo, but Deckard explains that her memories are false, taken from Dr. Tyrell's niece, and she leaves in tears.
0085_00.02.23.700-00.02.31.040	While searching Leon's apartment, Deckard finds a photo of Zhora and a synthetic snake scale and leads him to the strip club where Zhora works.
0085_00.02.31.040-00.02.38.370	Deckard kills Zhora and shortly after is told by Bryant that he needs to retire Rachael, as she has escaped from the Tyrell corporation.
0085_00.02.38.370-00.02.44.950	Deckard spots Rachael, but is attacked by Leon and eventually Rachael kills Leon using Deckard's gun.
0085_00.02.44.950-00.02.49.070	The two go back to Deckard's apartment and Deckard promises not to track her down.
0085_00.02.49.070-00.02.53.490	At Sebastian's apartment, Roy tells Pris that the other replicants are dead.
0085_00.02.53.490-00.03.01.330	Sebastian decides to continue to help them as he has an aging disorder, which causes him to die at a much faster rate, much like the replicants.
0085_00.03.01.330-00.03.07.950	Sebastian and Roy enter Dr. Tyrell's penthouse and Roy demands for Dr. Tyrell to extend his life.
0085_00.03.07.950-00.03.12.700	Tyrell tells Roy that it's impossible to extend his life and eventually Roy kills him.
0085_00.03.12.700-00.03.19.040	Sebastian and Roy take an elevator down together and though not shown, it is implied that Roy kills Sebastian.
0085_00.03.19.040-00.03.25.540	Back at Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but he manages to kill her as Roy returns.
0085_00.03.25.540-00.03.30.990	Roy begins to die from reaching the end of his lifespan and begins to chase Deckard, ending up on the roof.
0085_00.03.30.995-00.03.34.160	Deckard tries to jump to another roof, but misses and is left hanging.
0085_00.03.34.160-00.03.37.360	Roy easily makes the jump and pulls Deckard up.
0085_00.03.37.360-00.03.43.370	As Roy's time runs out, he says that his memories will be lost in time, like tears in the rain.
0085_00.03.43.370-00.03.50.560	Officer Gaff arrives and shouts to Deckard about Rachael, saying it's too bad she won't live, but then again who does.
0085_00.03.50.560-00.03.54.410	Deckard returns to his apartment, finding Rachael safe in his bed.
0085_00.03.54.410-00.04.01.120	Deckard finds a small tinfoil origami unicorn on the floor from Gaff and recalls Gaff's final words.
0085_00.04.01.120-00.04.09.650	The unicorn refers to a dream that Deckard had earlier in the film, implying that Officer Gaff knew what Deckard was dreaming about because Deckard himself was in fact a replicant.
0085_00.04.09.650-00.04.11.190	UNMATCHED
0085_00.04.11.190-00.04.14.660	Deckard and Rachael quickly leave the apartment as the film ends.
0085_00.04.14.665-00.04.16.765	So that was the spoilers for Blade Runner.
0085_00.04.16.765-00.04.20.530	If you have another film you'd like to see me spoil, please let me know in the comments below.

0086_00.00.11.325-00.00.15.065	Today we're talking about the 2015 comedy film, Daddy's Home.
0086_00.00.15.065-00.00.16.310	So let's get started.
0086_00.00.16.310-00.00.24.940	Radio executive, Brad Whitaker, after months of struggling to grow closer to his wife's Sara's children, finally finds himself in the fatherly role.
0086_00.00.24.940-00.00.33.780	During a phone call from Sara's former husband, Dusty Mayron, who discovers Sara's marriage to Brad, it is announced he will be visiting the next day.
0086_00.00.33.780-00.00.38.290	Brad is convinced that it is important for the children that their father and stepfather establish boundaries with each other.
0086_00.00.38.295-00.00.40.255	UNMATCHED
0086_00.00.40.255-00.00.43.750	When Dusty arrives, Brad is intimidated by his appearance.
0086_00.00.43.750-00.00.52.180	During Dusty's stay, it is clear that he intends to drive Brad out of Sara's and the kids' lives, however, he continually charms Brad into letting him stay.
0086_00.00.52.180-00.00.58.610	After multiple instances of Dusty showing Brad up, Brad realizes what Dusty's motives are.
0086_00.00.58.610-00.01.03.060	The two men seem to reach an understanding after working together to teach their son a lesson.
0086_00.01.03.060-00.01.07.770	Additionally, Brad and Sara learn that they may have hope of having a child together.
0086_00.01.07.775-00.01.12.180	Brad is stunned when Dusty reveals that he still intends to drive Brad out of the family.
0086_00.01.12.180-00.01.20.070	Desperate, Brad spends tens of thousands of dollars on early Christmas gifts, including seats to a basketball game.
0086_00.01.20.070-00.01.28.920	At the game, Dusty reveals himself to be friends with the coach and an enraged Brad begins drinking heavily and goes on a rant about Dusty.
0086_00.01.28.920-00.01.32.260	This leads Brad to moving out of the house, forcing Dusty to step up as a Dad.
0086_00.01.32.260-00.01.34.890	Dusty becomes overwhelmed being a full-time father.
0086_00.01.34.890-00.01.39.395	He decides to quit and to leave on the day of a father-daughter dance.
0086_00.01.39.395-00.01.43.495	Brad is convinced to try to get Dusty to stay and they both go to the dance.

0088_00.02.25.330-00.02.36.960	They then witness Voldemort talking to Snape, telling Snape that the reason the Elder Wand hasn't been working properly for him is because Snape is the one who the wand shows allegience to, so Voldemort has Nagini kill Snape.
0088_00.02.36.960-00.02.37.990	UNMATCHED
0088_00.02.37.990-00.02.41.620	Before Snape dies, however, he gives his memories to Harry.
