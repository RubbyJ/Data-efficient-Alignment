0007_00.01.02.540-00.01.03.880	Pangborn directs Strange to  
0007_00.01.03.880-00.01.06.220	Kamar-Taj, 
0007_00.01.06.220-00.01.08.710	where he is taken in by Mordo,
0007_00.01.08.710-00.01.08.980	UNMATCHED: a sorcerer under the Ancient One.
0007_00.01.08.980-00.01.10.930	The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane
0007_00.01.10.940-00.01.12.930	and other dimensions,
0007_00.01.12.940-00.01.15.530	such as the Mirror Dimension.
0007_00.01.15.530-00.01.19.600	She eventually agrees to train Strange despite his arrogance,
0007_00.01.19.600-00.01.19.930	UNMATCHED: which reminds her of Kaecilius.
0007_00.01.19.930-00.01.24.010	Strange studies under the Ancient One
0007_00.01.24.010-00.01.24.280	UNMATCHED: and Mordo,
0007_00.01.24.280-00.01.25.830	and from ancient books in the library
0007_00.01.25.830-00.01.28.390	that is now guarded by the master Wong.
0007_00.01.28.430-00.01.37.060	Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called sanctums in New York City, London, and Hong Kong,
0007_00.01.37.080-00.01.40.180	which are all connected and accessible from Kamar-Taj.
0007_00.01.40.180-00.01.46.310	The Sorcerer's task is to protect the sanctums, 
0007_00.01.46.310-00.01.46.600	UNMATCHED: though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy into just walking again.
0007_00.01.46.630-00.01.48.560	Strange progresses quickly 
0007_00.01.48.560-00.01.51.310	and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages,
0007_00.01.51.310-00.01.53.430	learning to bend time with 
0007_00.01.53.430-00.01.55.640	the mystical Eye of Agamotto.
0007_00.01.55.660-00.02.01.710	Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, 
0007_00.02.01.710-00.02.01.990	UNMATCHED: drawing a comparison to Kaecilius's desire for eternal life.
0007_00.02.02.000-00.02.04.790	Kaecilius uses the stolen pages to contact 
0007_00.02.04.790-00.02.08.290	the powerful Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time is non-existent.
0007_00.02.08.310-00.02.12.000	Kaecilius destroys the London sanctum to weaken Earth's protection.
0007_00.02.12.000-00.02.13.910	The zealots then attack the New York sanctum,
0007_00.02.13.910-00.02.14.920	killing its guardian,
0007_00.02.14.940-00.02.17.110	but Strange holds them off 
0007_00.02.17.110-00.02.19.810	with the help of the Cloak of Levitation
0007_00.02.19.810-00.02.20.130	UNMATCHED: until Mordo and the Ancient One arrive.
0007_00.02.20.160-00.02.23.970	Strange and Mordo become disillusioned with the Ancient One
0007_00.02.23.970-00.02.28.510	after Kaecilius reveals that the Ancient One's long life to due to her drawing power from Dark Dimension.
0007_00.02.28.520-00.02.31.520	Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One
0007_00.02.31.520-00.02.32.760	and escapes to Hong Kong.
0007_00.02.32.760-00.02.40.410	Before dying she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius.
0007_00.02.40.410-00.02.41.280	Strange and Mordo
0007_00.02.41.280-00.02.42.910	arrive in Hong Kong
0007_00.02.42.910-00.02.43.550	to find Wong dead,
0007_00.02.43.570-00.02.45.240	the sanctum destroyed,
0007_00.02.45.240-00.02.47.640	and the Dark Dimension irresistibly engulfing Earth.
0007_00.02.47.680-00.02.48.370	Strange uses the Eye
0007_00.02.48.370-00.02.50.580	to reverse time
0007_00.02.50.580-00.02.52.450	and save Wong,
0007_00.02.52.460-00.02.54.910	then creates an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension
0007_00.02.54.910-00.02.58.210	that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment of time.
0007_00.02.58.210-00.03.00.250	After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, 
0007_00.03.00.250-00.03.04.230	Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he leave Earth
0007_00.03.04.230-00.03.08.320	and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the time loop.
0007_00.03.08.320-00.03.10.380	Disgusted by Strange and the Ancient One defying nature's laws,
0007_00.03.10.380-00.03.13.080	Mordo departs.
0007_00.03.13.120-00.03.15.520	Strange returns the Eye to Kamar-Taj
0007_00.03.15.520-00.03.18.430	and takes up residence in the New York sanctum to continue his studies.
0007_00.03.18.450-00.03.21.100	In a mid-credits scene, Strange decides to help
0007_00.03.21.100-00.03.24.980	Thor, who has brought his brother Loki to earth to search for their father Odin.
0007_00.03.25.000-00.03.27.310	In a post-credits scene, Mordo confronts
0007_00.03.27.310-00.03.28.070	Pangborn
0007_00.03.28.070-00.03.32.600	and siphons the energy that he uses to walk,
0007_00.03.32.600-00.03.32.900	UNMATCHED: stating that Earth has too many sorcerers.
0008_00.00.04.120-00.00.05.030	In 1988,
0008_00.00.05.030-00.00.05.670	Peter Quill
0008_00.00.05.670-00.00.06.390	watches his mother die,
0008_00.00.06.390-00.00.07.580	runs outside in tears,
0008_00.00.07.580-00.00.10.300	and is picked up by some space bastards known as the Ravagers.
0008_00.00.10.300-00.00.14.100	Fast forward 26 years and Quill, a.k.a. Star Lord, is on Morag,
0008_00.00.14.100-00.00.15.250	listening to an awesome mixtape.
0008_00.00.15.270-00.00.16.690	He steals an expensive looking Orb
0008_00.00.16.700-00.00.18.940	from under the nose of this dude, Korath,
0008_00.00.18.940-00.00.20.820	and against the wishes of his old Ravager buddy, Yondu.
0008_00.00.20.840-00.00.22.550	Yondu then puts a bounty on Quill's head.
0008_00.00.22.570-00.00.23.500	Korath goes back to tell his boss, 
0008_00.00.23.510-00.00.25.740	Ronan, 
0008_00.00.25.740-00.00.26.700	UNMATCHED: that Quill stole the Orb
0008_00.00.26.700-00.00.27.310	UNMATCHED: and took it to sell on Xandar. Korath goes back to tell his boss, Ronan, that Quill stole the Orb and took it to sell on Xandar.
0008_00.00.27.310-00.00.30.250	Ronan is this angry blue guy who chills with the two adopted daughters of Thanos,
0008_00.00.30.260-00.00.31.065	Nebula
0008_00.00.31.070-00.00.31.660	and Gamora.
0008_00.00.31.660-00.00.37.820	Ronan's people, the Kree, have a thousand-year beef with the Xandarian people,
0008_00.00.37.820-00.00.38.150	UNMATCHED: and Ronan wants to give the Orb to Thanos so that Thanos will help him destroy Xandar.
0008_00.00.38.150-00.00.40.030	Nebula was going to get the Orb back, 
0008_00.00.40.040-00.00.42.350	but Gamora's like, "No, bitch. I know the area. I'll get it."
0008_00.00.42.360-00.00.43.190	Down on Xandar,
0008_00.00.43.190-00.00.44.550	Quill is accosted by Gamora.
0008_00.00.44.550-00.00.47.790	Meanwhile, Rocket Raccoon gets a "what's up" message about the bounty on Quill
0008_00.00.47.790-00.00.49.670	and goes after him with his friend, Groot.
0008_00.00.49.670-00.00.49.900	There's a big fight,
0008_00.00.49.900-00.00.51.630	Gamora cuts Groot's fucking arms off,
0008_00.00.51.630-00.00.53.970	and then the four of them are arrested and sent to space prison
0008_00.00.53.970-00.00.56.260	-- the Kyln.
0008_00.00.56.260-00.00.58.380	Gamora then explains that she actually plans to betray Ronan and sell the Orb to a buyer,
0008_00.00.58.380-00.00.59.660	Groot says "I am Groot",
0008_00.00.59.660-00.01.01.230	and Quill gets a spray tan.
0008_00.01.01.230-00.01.03.890	While incarcerated, this big bastard, Drax the Destroyer, shows up.
0008_00.01.03.900-00.01.06.120	He wants to kill Gamora because Ronan killed his family.
0008_00.01.06.120-00.01.08.780	But Quill convinces him to work with them and kill Ronan together.
0008_00.01.08.780-00.01.11.500	And since Gamora plans to sell the Orb for 4 billion units,
0008_00.01.11.500-00.01.15.510	Rocket decides to help them too for a share of that, rather than cash in on Quill's bounty.
0008_00.01.15.510-00.01.16.710	"I am still Groot."
0008_00.01.16.710-00.01.19.710	Back at Ronan's crib, Ronan finds out that Gamora is going to betray him
0008_00.01.19.710-00.01.23.350	and gets torn a new one by Thanos for alienating his favorite daughter, Gamora.
0008_00.01.23.360-00.01.25.550	Nebula's there like, "Fucking bitch".
0008_00.01.25.550-00.01.27.780	Back at the Kyln, Rocket puts together a complicated plan to escape
0008_00.01.27.780-00.01.29.390	and it all kicks off.
0008_00.01.29.390-00.01.33.910	"I am Groot, motherfucker!"
0008_00.01.33.910-00.01.34.860	There's punching,
0008_00.01.34.870-00.01.36.430	there's kicking,
0008_00.01.36.430-00.01.38.550	there's raccoons with guns -- it's epic.
0008_00.01.38.550-00.01.39.760	They turn off the gravity,
0008_00.01.39.760-00.01.40.590	collect their things,
0008_00.01.40.590-00.01.42.510	and hightail it back into space.
0008_00.01.42.510-00.01.43.470	Next stop: somewhere called Knowhere.
0008_00.01.43.470-00.01.44.230	They meet they Collector
0008_00.01.44.230-00.01.45.110	and show him the Orb.
0008_00.01.45.110-00.01.46.230	He explains that it's actually 
0008_00.01.46.230-00.01.47.740	a super-powerful Infinity Stone,
0008_00.01.47.740-00.01.50.230	and that you definitely shouldn't touch it, because you will blow up
0008_00.01.50.230-00.01.51.630	unless you are an all-powerful being.
0008_00.01.51.650-00.01.53.550	His slave's like, "Fuck that, I'm getting out of here!"
0008_00.01.53.550-00.01.54.330	and grabs it.
0008_00.01.54.340-00.01.55.540	Big explosion -- dead.
0008_00.01.55.540-00.01.56.330	Gamora and Quill
0008_00.01.56.330-00.01.57.310	take the Stone
0008_00.01.57.310-00.01.57.630	UNMATCHED: and get out of there.
0008_00.01.57.630-00.02.00.790	She wants to give it to the Nova Corps so they can keep it safe from Ronan or Thanos.
0008_00.02.00.790-00.02.03.140	Meanwhile, Drax has been getting absolutely wasted
0008_00.02.03.140-00.02.04.510	and actually called Ronan up for a fight,
0008_00.02.04.510-00.02.05.950	so he shows up with his crew.
0008_00.02.05.950-00.02.06.870	At the same time, it seems Yondu
0008_00.02.06.870-00.02.07.930	managed to track Quill down as well;
0008_00.02.07.940-00.02.09.550	what a nightmare.
0008_00.02.09.550-00.02.11.910	Ronan throws Drax into a pool of Sunny Delight,
0008_00.02.11.910-00.02.12.370	and Nebula chases
0008_00.02.12.370-00.02.12.780	Gamora
0008_00.02.12.780-00.02.13.460	into space,
0008_00.02.13.470-00.02.14.100	blows up her pod,
0008_00.02.14.100-00.02.15.010	and takes the Orb.
0008_00.02.15.040-00.02.16.100	Quill calls Yondu for help, 
0008_00.02.16.100-00.02.16.950	floats out to space,
0008_00.02.16.950-00.02.19.230	and saves Gamora
0008_00.02.19.230-00.02.20.470	before Yondu and crew show up just in time to pull them aboard.
0008_00.02.20.470-00.02.22.070	So now Ronan's got the Infinity Stone.
0008_00.02.22.080-00.02.23.750	He jams it into his hammer
0008_00.02.23.750-00.02.27.900	and he's like, "I don't need you anymore, Thanos!  I'm going to destroy Xandar myself, and then I'll kill you!"
0008_00.02.27.900-00.02.31.060	Nebula's like, "Yeah, and I'll help too!  I hate you, Dad!"
0008_00.02.31.060-00.02.33.700	Back with the Ravagers, Quill get slapped around a little
0008_00.02.33.710-00.02.34.970	before convincing Yondu to let them go.
0008_00.02.34.980-00.02.37.220	He says if they use Gamora's inside knowledge and all work together,
0008_00.02.37.220-00.02.39.010	they can retrieve the stone, and Yondu can have it.
0008_00.02.39.010-00.02.42.060	So Rocket, Drax, and Groot jump aboard the ship as well, and after a few arguments,
0008_00.02.42.060-00.02.43.420	they have a montage
0008_00.02.43.420-00.02.44.420	and come up with a plan to take down Ronan.
0008_00.02.44.420-00.02.45.430	Quill alerts the Nova Corps
0008_00.02.45.430-00.02.46.540	that Ronan is on his way,
0008_00.02.46.550-00.02.48.300	and with the help of the Ravagers and Nova Corps,
0008_00.02.48.300-00.02.50.270	some of the guys manage to get aboard Ronan's ship.
0008_00.02.50.270-00.02.52.590	Gamora and Nebula finally settle their sibling rivalry,
0008_00.02.52.590-00.02.54.220	and Groot, Quill, and Drax take care of the guards
0008_00.02.54.220-00.02.55.050	and Korath.
0008_00.02.55.070-00.02.56.120	By this point, Ronan
0008_00.02.56.120-00.02.57.340	has killed about a thousand of the Nova Corps.
0008_00.02.57.360-00.02.58.020	The guys confront him,
0008_00.02.58.020-00.02.59.110	but he's just too powerful.
0008_00.02.59.110-00.03.00.100	He's about to kill Drax,
0008_00.03.00.100-00.03.01.630	but then Rocket flies through the window
0008_00.03.01.630-00.03.02.670	and just wrecks the whole ship.
0008_00.03.02.670-00.03.04.150	So the heroes are now hurtling towards the ground,
0008_00.03.04.150-00.03.05.180	but Groot uses some tree magic
0008_00.03.05.190-00.03.06.620	to surround them
0008_00.03.06.620-00.03.07.390	with this wooden cocoon.
0008_00.03.07.400-00.03.10.860	Rocket has tears streaming down his face and he's like, "No, Groot!  This will kill you!"
0008_00.03.10.860-00.03.13.180	Groot replies, "We are Groot."
0008_00.03.13.190-00.03.13.960	The ship crashes
0008_00.03.13.970-00.03.14.740	and the guys come to.
0008_00.03.14.740-00.03.16.460	Unfortunately, Ronan also survived.
0008_00.03.16.480-00.03.18.700	But out of nowhere, Quill just starts singing and dancing
0008_00.03.18.700-00.03.19.500	to distract him,
0008_00.03.19.500-00.03.19.870	allowing Drax to blast
0008_00.03.19.870-00.03.21.180	the Stone out of his hammer.
0008_00.03.21.180-00.03.22.860	Quill grabs it just in time, 
0008_00.03.22.870-00.03.24.210	and good guys join hands to share out the impact.
0008_00.03.24.220-00.03.25.420	Ronan: dead.

0012_00.03.08.660-00.03.14.125	Stark lures Stane atop the Stark Industries building and instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor there.
0012_00.03.14.125-00.03.17.385	This unleashes a massive electrical surge
0012_00.03.17.385-00.03.19.760	that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him.

0013_00.01.23.865-00.01.26.550	Eggsy calls the number on the medal.

0013_00.02.20.925-00.02.29.530	duing which Valentine reveals that he knew Hart's true occupation beforehand, and ultimately spares him long enough for Valentine to learn more about Kingsman.
0013_00.02.29.530-00.02.34.330	Hart tracks Valentine to an obscure hate group's church in Kentucky, United States, 
0013_00.02.34.330-00.02.36.750	where Hart realizes too late that it is a trap.
0013_00.02.36.750-00.02.39.690	Valentine uses his SIM cards to broadcast a tone
0013_00.02.39.690-00.02.42.590	that causes everyone in the church to become uncontrollably violent.
0013_00.02.42.595-00.02.48.895	A comical brawl to the death erupts, during which Hart massacres most of the people in the church,

0013_00.02.50.370-00.02.50.930	Eggsy,

0013_00.03.11.825-00.03.15.560	but Eggsy distracts Arthur and switches the glasses before they drink.
0013_00.03.15.560-00.03.23.240	Arthur explains Valentine's views before he realizes this: humanity is akin to a virus and global warming is the Earth's equivalent of a fever.
0013_00.03.23.240-00.03.34.580	Valentine intends to broadcast his neurological wave worldwide to cause a massive culling of the human race to rescue it from extinction.
0013_00.03.34.580-00.03.39.085	Only those who Valentine deems worthy of living, his allies, who have protective microchips implanted in their heads, and the VIPs he kidnapped, will be spared. 
0013_00.03.39.085-00.03.44.225	Shortly afterwards, Arthur activates the poison when Eggsy refuses to join his side, 
0013_00.03.44.225-00.03.46.760	unwittingly killing himself.
0013_00.03.46.760-00.03.52.560	Unsure whom to trust, Merlin decides that he, Eggsy and Roxy must stop Valentine on their own.
0013_00.03.52.560-00.04.00.990	Roxy rides a high-altitude balloon into the stratosphere to disrupt Valentine's impending broadcast by destroying one of his satellites, 
0013_00.04.00.990-00.04.05.760	while Eggsy and Merlin infiltrate Valentine's mountain bunker complex in Argentina.

0013_00.04.07.465-00.04.10.825	but Valentine gets a business contact to replace it,
0013_00.04.10.825-00.04.13.195	then activates the signal, which requires his constant palm print, 
0013_00.04.13.195-00.04.15.290	causing worldwide violence.
0013_00.04.15.290-00.04.19.360	Eggsy is recognized and engages in a running shootout with Valentine's henchmen.
0013_00.04.19.360-00.04.22.730	Eventually both he and Merlin are cornered separately,
0013_00.04.22.730-00.04.26.930	but at Eggsy's suggestion, Merlin hacks into Valentine's system
0013_00.04.26.930-00.04.34.160	and causes the implants to explode, killing Valentine's henchmen and every convert when their heads explode,
0013_00.04.34.160-00.04.35.370	UNMATCHED: except Valentine and Gazelle, neither of whom carried implants.

0013_00.04.39.425-00.04.44.385	and then spears Valentine with the sharpened tip of Gazelle's prosthetic leg.
0013_00.04.44.385-00.04.46.165	Valentine falls to the ground floor
0013_00.04.46.165-00.04.47.495	where he eventually dies.

0013_00.04.59.460-00.05.05.770	Eggsy then dispatches him in exactly the same manner that Hart dealt with one of Dean's henchmen earlier.
0014_00.00.11.780-00.00.17.490	In 2029, no mutants have been born in 25 years.

0016_00.02.07.635-00.02.09.535	Ash's head is removed, revealing that he is actually an Android.
0016_00.02.09.560-00.02.11.870	Parker interrogates the reainmiated head of Ash,
0016_00.02.11.880-00.02.16.870	learning Ash's role was to capture the creature and bring it back for analysis, 
0016_00.02.16.870-00.02.21.030	regardless of whether the crew survives or not.
0016_00.02.21.100-00.02.24.160	Parker decides to destroy Ash.
0016_00.02.24.222-00.02.25.832	The surviving three crew members decide to set the ship for self-destruct
0016_00.02.25.832-00.02.27.637	and try to escape
0016_00.02.27.637-00.02.29.237	on the shuttle.
0016_00.02.29.252-00.02.32.202	Two of them are killed by the alien,
0016_00.02.32.212-00.02.34.022	leaving only Ripley.
0016_00.02.34.072-00.02.36.162	Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence
0016_00.02.36.172-00.02.38.652	and tries to flee the shuttle with the ship's cat, Jones, but is blocked by the alien.
0016_00.02.38.717-00.02.40.492	She runs back and forth a bit
0016_00.02.40.492-00.02.44.132	but eventually is able to board the shuttle
0016_00.02.44.147-00.02.46.637	right after the ship explodes.
0016_00.02.46.717-00.02.49.327	Ripley discovers that the alien is on board the shuttle, 
0016_00.02.49.327-00.02.50.857	puts on a spacesuit,
0016_00.02.50.857-00.02.51.932	and opens the airlock,
0016_00.02.51.932-00.02.53.942	forcing the alien and her into outer space.
0016_00.02.53.962-00.02.56.522	She is able to fire a grappling hook, 
0016_00.02.56.537-00.03.00.477	but this also helps the alien get back to the ship.
0016_00.03.00.492-00.03.03.112	Ripley fires the ship's engines
0016_00.03.03.117-00.03.05.697	blastting the alien eventually into outer space.
0016_00.03.05.722-00.03.09.122	Ripley and the cat turn into stasis and travel back to Earth.
0017_00.00.25.995-00.00.28.995	The film opens with Ellen Ripley from the first film
0017_00.00.28.995-00.00.33.440	after being rescused from drifting through outer space in stasis for 57 years.
0017_00.00.33.440-00.00.39.740	She is debriefed by her employers, Wayland-Yutani, over the destruction of the ship,
0017_00.00.39.740-00.00.43.910	however, they don't believe her claims that the alien killed her ship's crew and forced her to destroy the ship.
0017_00.00.43.910-00.00.53.080	The exomoon, where the original ship encountered the alien eggs, is now home to a terraforming colony, known as Hadley's Hope.
0017_00.00.53.080-00.00.59.370	When contact is lost with Hadley's Hope, Weyland-Yutuni's representative, Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman
0017_00.00.59.370-00.01.02.325	ask Ripley to accompany them to investigate the disturbance.
0017_00.01.02.325-00.01.06.865	Ripley initially refuses,
0017_00.01.06.865-00.01.09.210	but she changes her mind under the condition that Burke promises to exterminate and not capture any aliens that are found.
0017_00.01.09.210-00.01.12.860	Aboard the spaceship,
0017_00.01.12.860-00.01.20.070	 she is introduced to the ship's android, Bishop, which Ripley is initially hostile towards
0017_00.01.20.070-00.01.23.280	because of her experience with the treacherous android, Ash, from the first film.
0017_00.01.23.280-00.01.25.770	Their dropship finds the colony's deserted.
0017_00.01.25.770-00.01.31.980	Inside, they find makeshift barricades and signs of a struggle, but no bodies.
0017_00.01.31.985-00.01.35.765	They also find 2 live face huggers in a containment tank in the medical lab,
0017_00.01.35.765-00.01.40.915	as well as one survivor, a traumatized young girl, nicknamed Newt, 
0017_00.01.40.915-00.01.42.700	who is hiding in the ventiliation system.
0017_00.01.42.700-00.01.45.620	The crew uses the colony's computer to locate the colonists,
0017_00.01.45.620-00.01.51.950	who are grouped beneath the fusion powered atmosphere processing station.
0017_00.01.51.950-00.01.55.230	When they arrive, however, they find the colonists are cocooned, serving as incubators for the aliens' offspring.
0017_00.01.55.230-00.01.57.990	When the marines kill a newborn alien,
0017_00.01.57.990-00.02.01.370	the aliens are aroused and attack,
0017_00.02.01.370-00.02.04.120	killing and capturing several of the marines.
0017_00.02.04.125-00.02.06.035	When an inexperienced Gorman panics,
0017_00.02.06.035-00.02.08.705	Ripley takes control of their vehicle
0017_00.02.08.705-00.02.11.280	 and rams it through the nest to rescue some of the marines.
0017_00.02.11.280-00.02.13.980	Dropships are sent to recover the survivors,
0017_00.02.13.980-00.02.16.660	but a stowaway alien kills the pilots, 
0017_00.02.16.660-00.02.19.230	causing it to crash into the station.
0017_00.02.19.230-00.02.22.190	The crew barricades themselves inside the colony command center.
0017_00.02.22.195-00.02.28.655	Ripley discovers that Burke deliberately sent colonists to investigate the infested ship, 
0017_00.02.28.655-00.02.32.290	believing he could become wealthy recovering the alien specimens for use as biological weapons.
0017_00.02.32.290-00.02.35.910	Ripley threatens to expose him, 
0017_00.02.35.910-00.02.40.240	but they soon discover that the power plant was damaged by the dropship crash and will soon explode.
0017_00.02.40.240-00.02.47.360	The android, Bishop, volunteers to crawl through several 100 meters of piping conduits to reach the colony's transmitter
0017_00.02.47.360-00.02.49.530	and remotely pilot the ship's remaining dropship to the surface.
0017_00.02.49.530-00.02.56.450	Ripley and the young girl, Newt, find themselves locked in a room with 2 face huggers, which have been released from their tanks.
0017_00.02.56.455-00.03.01.535	Ripley triggers the fire alarm to alert the marines,
0017_00.03.01.535-00.03.03.370	who rescue them and kill the creatures.
0017_00.03.03.370-00.03.18.940	Ripley accuses Burke of releasing the face huggers so that they would impregnate her and Newt, allowing him to smuggle the alien embryos past Earth's quarantine, planning to kill the rest of the marines in hypersleep during the return so that no one could contradict his version of the events.
0017_00.03.18.940-00.03.20.210	Before the marines can execute Burke,
0017_00.03.20.210-00.03.22.940	the electricity is cut
0017_00.03.22.940-00.03.24.905	and aliens assault through the ceiling.
0017_00.03.24.905-00.03.27.565	Burke, Gorman, and other marines are all killed
0017_00.03.27.565-00.03.29.295	and Newt is captured.
0017_00.03.29.295-00.03.32.955	Ripley and an injured marine, named Hicks, 
0017_00.03.32.955-00.03.36.445	reach the android, Bishop, in the second dropship, but Ripley refuses to abandon the young girl, Newt.
0017_00.03.36.445-00.03.41.105	The group arrives at the processing station, 
0017_00.03.41.105-00.03.44.205	allowing a heavily-armed Ripley to enter the hive
0017_00.03.44.205-00.03.45.860	and rescue Newt.
0017_00.03.45.860-00.03.48.980	As they escape, the 2 encounter the alien queen in her egg chamber.
0017_00.03.48.985-00.03.51.035	Pursued by the queen,
0017_00.03.51.035-00.03.55.030	Ripley and Newt rendezvous with Bishop and Hicks on the dropship.
0017_00.03.55.030-00.03.56.350	All 4 escape
0017_00.03.56.350-00.04.00.740	moments before the station explodes with the colony consumed by the nuclear blast.
0017_00.04.00.750-00.04.05.040	On the ship, the group discovers that the alien queen stowed away on the dropship's landing gear.
0017_00.04.05.040-00.04.08.085	The queen emerges and tears Bishop in half.
0017_00.04.08.085-00.04.09.325	The queen then advances on Newt,
0017_00.04.09.325-00.04.14.110	but Ripley fights back using an exosuit
0017_00.04.14.115-00.04.16.545	and expels it through the air lock into space.
0017_00.04.16.545-00.04.20.215	Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and the badly damaged Bishop
0017_00.04.20.215-00.04.22.945	enter hyper sleep for the return trip to Earth.
0018_00.00.27.085-00.00.31.240	The film opens with the Avengers raiding a hydro facility in Segovia,
0018_00.00.31.240-00.00.34.740	commanded by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker
0018_00.00.34.745-00.00.36.820	who's been experimenting on humans 
0018_00.00.36.820-00.00.39.490	using the scepter previously wielded by Loki.
0018_00.00.39.490-00.00.45.740	They encounter test subjects, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, who are Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch,
0018_00.00.45.740-00.00.47.480	as well as apprehending Strucker and Loki's scepter.
0018_00.00.47.510-00.00.55.190	As a quick side note, these are actually the kids of Magneto from the X-Men Universe but due to licensing issues they cannot refer to this.
0018_00.00.55.205-00.00.58.780	Stark and Banner, The Hulk, discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem
0018_00.00.58.780-00.01.04.820	and secretly use it to complete Stark's Ultron Global Defense Program.
0018_00.01.04.830-00.01.08.660	It creates a sentient being who believes he must eradicate humanity to save Earth.

0018_00.01.16.995-00.01.20.495	uses the resources at the Hydra base to upgrade his body and build an army of robot drones.
0018_00.01.20.495-00.01.21.950	Having killed Strucker, 
0018_00.01.21.950-00.01.24.480	he recruits the Maximoff siblings and

0018_00.01.27.030-00.01.29.120	The Avengers arrive and attack Ultron,
0018_00.01.29.120-00.01.32.660	but the Scarlet Witch subdues them with haunting visions.
0018_00.01.32.670-00.01.35.570	The team goes into hiding in a safe house, reeling from the visions.
0018_00.01.35.585-00.01.37.335	Thor departs
0018_00.01.37.335-00.01.42.120	to consult Dr. Erik Selvig on the meaning of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination.
0018_00.01.42.120-00.01.48.780	Nick Fury arrives and encourages the rest of the team not to break apart and to form a plan to stop Ultron.
0018_00.01.48.800-00.01.50.080	Meanwhile, Ultron forces the teens' friend, Dr. Helen Cho, 
0018_00.01.50.085-00.01.51.815	to use her synthetic tissue technology
0018_00.01.51.815-00.01.54.105	together with the vibranium
0018_00.01.54.105-00.01.55.660	and the scepter's gem
0018_00.01.55.660-00.01.59.600	to perfect a new body for him.
0018_00.01.59.600-00.02.01.580	AS Ultron uploads himself into the body,
0018_00.02.01.585-00.02.05.615	the Scarlet Witch reads his mind,
0018_00.02.05.615-00.02.06.665	discovering his plan for human extinction.
0018_00.02.06.670-00.02.07.800	The Maximoff siblings turn against Ultron.
0018_00.02.07.800-00.02.11.290	Some of the team find Ultron and

0018_00.02.19.905-00.02.21.055	while Stark secretly uploads Jarvis, who hid from Ultron inside the internet, 
0018_00.02.21.055-00.02.23.165	into the synthetic body.
0018_00.02.23.185-00.02.26.320	Thor returns to help activate the body,
0018_00.02.26.320-00.02.31.170	explaining that the gem on its brow is from the infinity stones and was part of his vision.
0018_00.02.31.170-00.02.36.790	This vision and the Maximoff siblings accompany the Avengers' return to Segovia,
0018_00.02.36.790-00.02.40.200	where Ultron used the remaining vibranium to build a machine
0018_00.02.40.200-00.02.45.900	to lift a large part of the capital skyward, intending to crash it into the ground 
0018_00.02.45.905-00.02.47.585	to cause global extinction.
0018_00.02.47.590-00.02.49.730	Banner rescuse Black Widow
0018_00.02.49.735-00.02.51.945	while the Avengers fight Ultron's army.
0018_00.02.51.950-00.02.53.890	Fury and others evacuate civilians.
0018_00.02.53.905-00.02.57.880	Quicksilver dies when he shields Hawkeye from gunfire
0018_00.02.57.880-00.03.03.480	and a vengeful Scarlet Witch abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body,
0018_00.03.03.485-00.03.04.365	which allows one of his drones to activate the machine.
0018_00.03.04.370-00.03.05.870	The city plummets
0018_00.03.05.885-00.03.11.615	but Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the land mass.
0018_00.03.11.615-00.03.14.725	In the aftermath, the Hulk departs
0018_00.03.14.725-00.03.18.855	while the vision confronts Ultron's last remaining body.
0018_00.03.18.860-00.03.21.280	Later, the Avengers establish a new base.
0018_00.03.21.280-00.03.23.610	Thor returns to Asgard, Stark leaves,
0018_00.03.23.620-00.03.25.390	Hawkeye retires,
0018_00.03.25.390-00.03.27.480	and Captain America, with Black Widow,
0018_00.03.27.480-00.03.28.700	prepare to train new Avengers.
0018_00.03.28.710-00.03.36.310	In a mid credits scene, we see Thanos vow to retrieve the Infinity Stones for himself, hinting at the next Avengers film.
0019_00.00.17.200-00.00.19.460	The film is set in Hill Valley, California
0019_00.00.19.465-00.00.25.150	 and follows a stereotypical 80's teenager named Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox.
0019_00.00.25.150-00.00.31.180	Marty has a girlfriend named Jennifer who isn't featured all that much in this film but is referred to throughout the series.
0019_00.00.31.200-00.00.33.280	Marty lives at home with his family
0019_00.00.33.290-00.00.35.990	where his father, George McFly,
0019_00.00.35.990-00.00.38.890	is constantly bullied and berated by his supervisor, Biff Tannen.
0019_00.00.38.900-00.00.43.570	George is a sheepish and feeble man and bows to pretty much whatever Biff tells him to do.
0019_00.00.43.580-00.00.51.860	Marty's Mom, Lorraine is an overweight woman who seems to be more focused on the past, such as how she met George after she accidentally hit him with her car.
0019_00.00.51.870-00.01.03.400	An important feature that continues throughout the most of these films is multiple actors play multiple roles, depending on what year that portion of the film is taking place.
0019_00.01.03.400-00.01.07.320	We also meet Marty's friend, Emmett Brown, typically referred to as Doc.
0019_00.01.07.320-00.01.13.160	Doc is a scientist who is always working on some crazy and wacky experiment and Marty seems to help out when he can.
0019_00.01.13.170-00.01.16.670	Marty ends up later meeting Doc in a parking lot
0019_00.01.16.670-00.01.21.070	where Doc shows Marty the DeLorean that he's converted into a time machine.
0019_00.01.21.070-00.01.23.580	The DeLorean utilizes a flux capacitor
0019_00.01.23.580-00.01.27.720	which is powered by plutonium which Doc stole from a group of Libyan terrorists.
0019_00.01.27.720-00.01.30.080	While running some initial tests on the vehicle, however,
0019_00.01.30.080-00.01.32.590	the Libyan terrorists show up and gun down Doc.
0019_00.01.32.600-00.01.34.960	Marty jumps into the DeLorean to avoid getting shot himself,
0019_00.01.34.960-00.01.44.190	getting up to the famous 88 miles per hour, and gets sent back in time to November fifth, 1955.
0019_00.01.44.205-00.01.48.035	Now in the year nineteen fifty-five, Marty runs into a young George McFly,
0019_00.01.48.035-00.01.50.975	who is being bullied by a young Biff Tannen.
0019_00.01.50.980-00.01.53.300	After Marty saves George from Biff,
0019_00.01.53.300-00.01.57.210	Marty has to save George again from being hit by a car,
0019_00.01.57.210-00.01.59.180	which ends up knocking out Marty instead.
0019_00.01.59.180-00.02.09.580	Marty begins to wake up and finds himself in a bedroom and begins talking about how he had a strange dream of being sent back into the past, thinking he is being comforted by his 1985 mother.
0019_00.02.09.595-00.02.15.685	Instead, however, he is actually being comforted by his 1955 mother, Lorraine, who is about the same age as him
0019_00.02.15.685-00.02.18.230	and is somewhat aggressively flirting with him.
0019_00.02.18.230-00.02.29.190	Marty is mortified, not only by the fact that he is being hit on by a younger version of his Mom, but he also realizes that he's ruined the opportunity where his Father originally met his Mother.
0019_00.02.29.200-00.02.32.650	Marty eventually finds the 1955 version of Doc Brown
0019_00.02.32.650-00.02.37.180	and Marty convinces him that he is actually from the year nineteen eighty-five.
0019_00.02.37.190-00.02.44.680	Marty expresses that he needs more plutonium so he can go back to his original time.
0019_00.02.44.685-00.02.47.565	However, Doc explains that getting plutonium is not a very easy task
0019_00.02.47.565-00.02.52.575	and they decide to use the famous historical lightning strike that will hit the clock tower later this week.
0019_00.02.52.585-00.03.00.045	They will use the one point twenty one gigawatts of power that comes from the lightning
0019_00.03.00.045-00.03.04.605	in order to allow the DeLorean to travel back to the year nineteen eighty-five.
0019_00.03.04.630-00.03.07.220	Marty realizes that after looking at a photo though
0019_00.03.07.225-00.03.11.905	 that him and his siblings are beginning to fade out of the picture because his parents had never met the way they were supposed to, causing them to never fall in love, and Marty to never be born
0019_00.03.11.905-00.03.25.910	So Marty begins to work on a plan to get his parents back together so that he can be born and the events of the film can still take place and not cause a paradox.
0019_00.03.25.910-00.03.29.410	Through a series of events, Marty ends up taking Lorraine, his mother, to a school dance.
0019_00.03.29.440-00.03.36.900	Marty's plan was to force himself on his mother, causing her to be offended and for George to come in and save the day.
0019_00.03.36.905-00.03.39.915	However, Biff shows up
0019_00.03.39.925-00.03.42.245	and Biff instead tries to force himself on Lorraine.
0019_00.03.42.260-00.03.44.690	George punches Biff, knocking him down,
0019_00.03.44.690-00.03.48.650	and Lorraine ends up going with George to the dance floor, where they have their first kiss.
0019_00.03.48.660-00.03.55.940	There is then a scene where Marty plays the guitar on the dance floor and really that doesn't have much to do with the story, but it's a relatively iconic scene.
0019_00.03.55.940-00.03.59.230	After leaving the dance, Marty returns to the clock tower where the lightning is supposed to hit.
0019_00.03.59.235-00.04.01.805	Doc has everything set up
0019_00.04.01.805-00.04.04.815	and Marty tries to give Doc a letter warning him about the Libyan terrorists.
0019_00.04.04.820-00.04.09.440	Doc rips up the letter out of fear that the knnowledge will result in catastrophic outcomes.
0019_00.04.09.450-00.04.10.030	UNMATCHED:  Marty decides that he would go back ten minutes earlier in the year nineteen eighty-five then he initially left, in order to warn Doc then.
0019_00.04.10.040-00.04.23.220	Marty then gets into the DeLorean, gets up to 88 miles per hour, and travels back to nineteen eighty-five, 
0019_00.04.23.220-00.04.26.080	where he hurries from the parking lot to try to save Doc.
0019_00.04.26.110-00.04.30.430	Unfortunately, however, Marty is too late and Doc is still shot
0019_00.04.30.430-00.04.36.200	and he sees the other version of Marty take off in the other DeLorean to go back to nineteen fifty-five.
0019_00.04.36.205-00.04.40.775	Initially, Marty runs down to Doc to be with him during his last moments
0019_00.04.40.775-00.04.41.875	and it turns out Doc was actually wearing a bulletproof vest 
0019_00.04.41.875-00.04.46.055	and he had actually taped up the letter that Marty had given him.
0019_00.04.46.060-00.04.53.200	Doc takes Marty back home and then Doc takes off for the year 2015 to see what the future has in store.
0019_00.04.53.210-00.04.56.770	The next morning, Marty finds that his family has drastically changed.
0019_00.04.56.775-00.04.57.955	They seem wealthier,
0019_00.04.57.955-00.05.02.695	 his father, George, is a more confident man, his mom, Lorraine is fit and in shape, 
0019_00.05.02.695-00.05.08.595	and even Biff, who in the beginning of the film was George's superior, is almost now a servant to the McFlys.
0019_00.05.08.600-00.05.11.060	Marty meets up with his girlfriend, Jennifer,
0019_00.05.11.060-00.05.23.600	only to be interrupted by Doc, who is wearing strange and new clothing and insists that they both must get into the car, stating that there is a problem with Marty and Jennifer's kids.
0019_00.05.23.600-00.05.24.730	The flim ends with one of its most famous lines.
0020_00.00.17.430-00.00.24.550	The film begins the same way the previous one ended, with Doc picking up Marty and Jennifer, 
0020_00.00.24.550-00.00.28.090	 taking them to the future in order to prevent their future son, Marty Jr., from participating in a robbery.
0020_00.00.28.090-00.00.36.780	They arrive in the future on October 21st, 2015.
0020_00.00.36.780-00.00.38.165	UNMATCHED: This is the actual date that they arrive, not all those crazy Photoshop dates that always appear on Facebook.
0020_00.00.38.165-00.00.41.735	When they arrive, Doc uses a device to make Jennifer sleep
0020_00.00.41.735-00.00.48.245	and Marty goes into town to pose as his son so he can refuse to participate in the robbery.
0020_00.00.48.250-00.00.57.020	While in the diner, Biff's grandson, Griff, (Remember Biff was the antagonist from the first film) enters to try to coerce who he thinks is Marty Jr. to help in the robbery.
0020_00.00.57.025-00.01.01.675	Marty refuses the offer and a big fight breaks out but eventually Marty wins
0020_00.01.01.675-00.01.04.855	and Griff and his friends are arrested.
0020_00.01.04.860-00.01.17.030	Before meeting back up with Doc though, Marty buys a sports Almanac, which shows all the winners of the major sporting events from 1950 to the year 2000, so several games that Marty still has not seen.
0020_00.01.17.040-00.01.23.710	Doc finds the Almanac, scolds Marty, telling him the serious issues that could arise from using this knowledge.
0020_00.01.23.710-00.01.30.390	Doc and Marty then both discover that the unconscious Jennifer was taken to her 2015 home and they need to go get her.
0020_00.01.30.400-00.01.35.370	While all this is going on, the much older Biff has been listening the entire time.
0020_00.01.35.370-00.01.39.090	While Marty and Doc are preoccupied with rescuing Jennifer from her future home, 
0020_00.01.39.090-00.01.43.760	Biff steals both the DeLorean and the Almanac, 
0020_00.01.43.760-00.01.50.140	goes back to the year nineteen fifty-five, in order to give the sports Almanac to a younger version of himself to make himself rich through betting.
0020_00.01.50.140-00.01.55.685	Biff then returns the DeLorean to the year 2015 with Doc and Marty unaware anything has happened.
0020_00.01.55.685-00.02.00.845	Doc and Marty, along with a still unconscious Jennifer, go back to nineteen eighty-five,
0020_00.02.00.845-00.02.06.780	only to find out that the town has drastically changed.
0020_00.02.06.780-00.02.11.520	Biff is now a very wealthy and corrupt man who has turned Hill Valley into a near apocalyptic society.
0020_00.02.11.530-00.02.13.060	Biff killed Marty's father
0020_00.02.13.060-00.02.15.360	and has forced Marty's mother, Lorraine, to marry him
0020_00.02.15.360-00.02.18.865	and Doc in this timeline has been committed to an insane asylum.
0020_00.02.18.865-00.02.25.405	After Marty discovers that Biff did use the Almanac and discovers what date he got the Almanac on,
0020_00.02.25.405-00.02.31.480	Marty rushes back to November 12, 1955 to prevent Biff from ever getting the Almanac.
0020_00.02.31.480-00.02.34.250	Marty sees Biff get the Almanac
0020_00.02.34.250-00.02.36.350	and follows Biff to the high school dance from the first film.
0020_00.02.36.350-00.02.38.110	A big chase eventually ensues
0020_00.02.38.110-00.02.40.260	and Marty gets the Almanac
0020_00.02.40.260-00.02.42.590	and destroys it,
0020_00.02.42.590-00.02.48.340	 however, while destroying the Almanac, the DeLorean which Doc is sitting in it struck by lightning, sending it back in time.
0020_00.02.48.340-00.02.55.740	Then, out of nowhere, a Western Union courier appears handing Marty a letter, that was from Doc,
0020_00.02.55.740-00.02.57.430	stating that he had been sent back to the year 1885.
0020_00.02.57.430-00.03.01.770	Marty then runs back into town to find the 1955 version of Doc.
0020_00.03.01.790-00.03.09.080	The 1955 Doc had just sent an earlier version of Marty from the first film away
0020_00.03.09.080-00.03.23.290	and upon seeing the new version of Marty appear, this causes him to faint and ends the film.
0021_00.00.17.610-00.00.23.990	The movie opens where the previous film left off, with Marty being in the year nineteen fifty-five, having just discovered that Doc is stuck in the year 1885.
0021_00.00.23.990-00.00.29.350	Marty finds the 1955 version of Doc, 
0021_00.00.29.350-00.00.32.040	and together they find the DeLorean, the one that was sent back to the year 1885,
0021_00.00.32.040-00.00.35.275	and repair it.
0021_00.00.35.275-00.00.44.905	While doing so, they discover Doc's tombstone from 1885, stating that he died six days after he wrote the letter to Marty,
0021_00.00.44.905-00.00.49.970	being killed by Buford Mad Dog Tannen.
0021_00.00.49.970-00.00.53.750	Note this is Biff's great-grandfather.
0021_00.00.53.760-00.00.54.290	UNMATCHED: Doc's tombstone states that he was killed over a matter of eighty dollars. 
0021_00.00.54.300-00.00.54.850	UNMATCHED:  I know this part is a bit confusing, but I'll do my best to keep it clear. 
0021_00.00.54.850-00.01.01.910	UNMATCHED
0021_00.01.01.920-00.01.08.340	Just to go over it again, the 1985 Doc was sent back to the year 1885 where the DeLorean was damaged, trapping him there.
0021_00.01.08.350-00.01.09.740	UNMATCHED: Doc in the year 1885 writes Marty a letter and has it post-dated to arrive at a very specific time and place in the year nineteen fifty-five.
0021_00.01.09.750-00.01.21.030	Marty receives the letter and after finding out that Doc is trapped
0021_00.01.21.030-00.01.24.830	and the location of the DeLorean, which Marty can use to time travel himself.
0021_00.01.24.835-00.01.29.615	Marty goes to find the 1955 version of Doc,
0021_00.01.29.615-00.01.35.835	which remember is 30 years younger than the Doc who got sent back to 1885.
0021_00.01.35.835-00.01.41.315	The younger Doc and Marty work together to repair the DeLorean
0021_00.01.41.315-00.01.46.455	and that's when they discovered that the older Doc, the one who was sent to the year 1885, was murdered just a few days later.
0021_00.01.46.460-00.01.57.550	So Marty takes the repaired DeLorean back to the year 1885 to intervene with the older Doc's murder.
0021_00.01.57.550-00.01.57.990	UNMATCHED:  A bit confusing, but I promise the rest of the movie is much more linear.
0021_00.01.57.990-00.02.03.410	Marty arrives in the year 1885, a few days before Doc's murder,
0021_00.02.03.410-00.02.05.160	to find Hill Valley has a very Old West feel to it.
0021_00.02.05.170-00.02.08.620	When Marty arrives, he is right in the middle of a Native American attack
0021_00.02.08.620-00.02.16.290	and the DeLorean gets damaged, causing it to leak fuel, making it unable to accelerate to 88 miles per hour, the speed needed for time travel.
0021_00.02.16.290-00.02.18.490	So Marty and Doc devise an alternative plan
0021_00.02.18.490-00.02.24.740	to have a train push the car up to the necessary speed of 88 miles per hour.
0021_00.02.24.745-00.02.27.575	While working on the train plan,
0021_00.02.27.575-00.02.30.440	Doc and Marty see a woman on a horse drawn wagon that is traveling out of control.
0021_00.02.30.440-00.02.35.790	Doc saves the woman, who is the town's school teacher, named Clara.
0021_00.02.35.790-00.02.44.190	Clara and Doc end up falling in love eventually but it takes some time because Doc is concerned what she will think or do about him being a man from the future.
0021_00.02.44.200-00.02.52.750	Marty also meets his Irish relatives that he has descended from, that look exactly like him.
0021_00.02.52.750-00.02.53.200	UNMATCHED:  On the whole, they add very little to the story.
0021_00.02.53.210-00.02.58.400	Marty, Doc, Clara and Marty's family all go into the town's festival, 
0021_00.02.58.400-00.03.05.740	where after a series of events, Marty yet again gets into a fight with a Tannen, this time being Mad Dog Tannen, the man who's supposed to kill Doc.
0021_00.03.05.750-00.03.09.840	The Sheriff breaks up their fight so Mad Dog decides to postpone the duel.
0021_00.03.09.840-00.03.11.490	Marty and Mad Dog end up having their duel, 
0021_00.03.11.490-00.03.14.360	which Marty wins.
0021_00.03.14.360-00.03.16.730	Mad Dog ends up in a pile of manure
0021_00.03.16.730-00.03.18.450	and is arrested for an earlier robbery.
0021_00.03.18.460-00.03.31.330	I didn't go into a great deal of detail in my other summaries of these movies about this, but there are many repeating motifs between the different versions of these characters, such as:  Marty waking up to his mother, 
0021_00.03.31.330-00.03.36.450	Biff getting arrested, and/or landing in manure, 
0021_00.03.36.450-00.03.45.570	Marty getting angry and being called chicken, and many, many, many others.
0021_00.03.45.570-00.03.47.040	UNMATCHED:  Really, they aren't that important to the story, but it's an interesting element that they carry throughout the films. 
0021_00.03.47.040-00.03.51.700	After defeating Mad Dog, Marty, Doc and Clara begin the train plan.
0021_00.03.51.700-00.03.56.730	Following a series of events, only Marty takes off in the DeLorean to the year nineteen eighty-five,
0021_00.03.56.730-00.03.59.850	 leaving Doc and Clara in the year 1885.
0021_00.03.59.850-00.04.02.870	The DeLorean is destroyed when it arrives, however.
0021_00.04.02.870-00.04.09.490	Marty returns to his girlfriend, Jennifer, who mind you, has been unconscious since the second film, who is now starting to wake up.
0021_00.04.09.490-00.04.12.290	Marty and Jennifer go back to the wreckage of the DeLorean
0021_00.04.12.290-00.04.20.080	when Doc appears in a train that has been fitted with a flux capacitor, making it a locomotive time machine.
0021_00.04.20.080-00.04.22.560	Doc is accompanied by Clara, among with their two children.
0021_00.04.22.570-00.04.29.980	The film ends with Doc and his family taking off in the locomotive, which flies away and into another time.
0022_00.00.18.962-00.00.22.242	The film takes place in the fictional city of Gotham,
0022_00.00.22.242-00.00.27.700	where a young Bruce Wayne falls down a well and is attacked by bats, developing his fear of bats.
0022_00.00.27.700-00.00.32.895	Bruce is the heir to Wayne Enterprises, a massive and wealthy corporation.
0022_00.00.32.895-00.00.39.575	Later on, we see Bruce and his parents are at an opera, where Bruce becomes frightened by performer dressed like a bat
0022_00.00.39.575-00.00.41.645	and asks his parents if he can leave.
0022_00.00.41.650-00.00.44.580	Once outside, his parents are mugged and killed in front of him
0022_00.00.44.580-00.00.47.110	by a man named Joe Chill.
0022_00.00.47.110-00.00.50.160	Bruce is left to be raised by his butler, Alfred.
0022_00.00.50.170-00.00.54.790	14 years later, Chill is freed from prison
0022_00.00.54.790-00.00.57.370	 in exchange for testimony against the mafia boss, Carmine Falcone.
0022_00.00.57.370-00.01.01.430	Bruce intended to murder Chill after his release,
0022_00.01.01.430-00.01.03.200	 however, Falcone has Chill killed.
0022_00.01.03.200-00.01.09.610	Bruce's childhood friend and assistant DA, Rachel, berates Bruce for trying to kill Chill.
0022_00.01.09.615-00.01.13.445	Bruce leaves Gotham

0022_00.01.18.695-00.01.22.535	who trains him to become a member of the League of Shadows,
0022_00.01.22.535-00.01.24.535	a secret martial arts society led by Ra's al Ghul.
0022_00.01.24.535-00.01.26.285	Bruce is trained to purge his fears through his training, 
0022_00.01.26.285-00.01.29.835	 in part through using hallucigenic flowers.
0022_00.01.29.835-00.01.34.665	After completing his training, 
0022_00.01.34.665-00.01.40.150	Bruce learns that the League of Shadows plans on destroying the city of Gotham to purge it of corruption and believes that Gotham is beyond saving.
0022_00.01.40.150-00.01.45.230	Bruce disagrees, starts a fight with the members of the League of Shadows and escapes.
0022_00.01.45.242-00.01.48.492	Ra's al Ghul is killed by falling debris

0022_00.01.54.995-00.01.56.915	He also takes an interest in his family's company, Wayne Enterprises,

0025_00.01.35.700-00.01.41.870	With the games being composed of past winners, the ages range from rather young to quite old.
0025_00.01.41.870-00.01.44.410	Some are still in great shape, or rather cunning,
0025_00.01.44.410-00.01.45.660	others may not fare as well.
0025_00.01.45.660-00.01.51.230	As they prepare for the games, Katniss makes some allies with the other tributes.
0025_00.01.51.235-00.01.53.865	Katniss once again makes a big spectacle
0025_00.01.53.865-00.02.01.410	during the pregame interviews, showing herself off as a mockingjay, the bird that is on a pendant that she wears and sort of a symbol that represents her.
0025_00.02.01.410-00.02.08.040	Peeta, even in an interview, tries to get the games stopped, by saying she's pregnant, but that doesn't stop the games.
0025_00.02.08.040-00.02.11.820	The games have a new head Game maker, Plutarch.
0025_00.02.11.825-00.02.17.165	As the games begin,
0025_00.02.17.165-00.02.18.075	Katniss has made a few allies, including Finnick, 
0025_00.02.18.075-00.02.20.285	Wiress, Beetee
0025_00.02.20.285-00.02.21.205	and Johanna.
0025_00.02.21.205-00.02.26.615	Through a series of events, Katniss and her team of allies end up shooting the force field around the arena with an electrified arrow,
0025_00.02.26.615-00.02.28.820	causing a power failure.
0025_00.02.28.820-00.02.34.280	A rebel aircraft is able to fly in and pick up most of the group, 
0025_00.02.34.280-00.02.35.370	UNMATCHED:  however, Johanna and Peeta are left behind.
0025_00.02.35.370-00.02.41.620	Also aboard the aircraft is Katniss' mentor, as well as Plutarch,
0025_00.02.41.620-00.02.45.500	revealing that the game maker has betrayed the capitol.
0025_00.02.45.500-00.02.50.830	It appears it was all a plot to incite a rebellion and everyone was in on it except for Katniss.
0025_00.02.50.830-00.02.54.300	When Katniss wakes up, she is furious that the rebels did not save Peeta.
0025_00.02.54.300-00.02.58.160	UNMATCHED
0025_00.02.58.160-00.03.01.260	UNMATCHED:  The aircraft though is brought to District 13, which was thought to be destroyed, but is actually the headquarters of the new rebellion.
0025_00.03.01.260-00.03.11.860	They arrive and Gail informs Katniss that her family is safe, but District 12 was destroyed by the capitol.
0025_00.03.11.860-00.03.12.680	UNMATCHED:  Clearly, this is a start of a civil war
0025_00.03.12.680-00.03.17.170	and this is where the film ends.
0026_00.00.20.010-00.00.23.151	The film takes place in futuristic Chicago,
0026_00.00.23.151-00.00.26.450	where society is been divided into five factions.
0026_00.00.26.450-00.00.31.750	The first is "Abnegation", the selfless government who always wears simple gray clothing.
0026_00.00.31.750-00.00.37.560	The second faction is "Amity"; it provides the food, values peace, and always wears red or orange.
0026_00.00.37.580-00.00.43.660	The third faction is "Candor", who are honest and judge for truth and wear white.
0026_00.00.43.690-00.00.50.310	The fourth faction is the "Dauntless", the brave protectors who wear black and oftentimes have tattoos.
0026_00.00.50.330-00.00.55.570	The final faction is "Erudite", the intellectual faction who wears blue.
0026_00.00.55.594-00.01.00.607	The remaining population is considered "Factionless", which are essentially the homeless of the society.
0026_00.01.00.640-00.01.10.151	At the age of sixteen, children in the society go through a drug-induced psychological test in which they determine which is the proper faction for them,
0026_00.01.10.151-00.01.12.340	and that is decided at the Choosing Ceremony.
0026_00.01.12.380-00.01.16.330	The film follows Beatrice Prior, was born into Abnegation.
0026_00.01.16.330-00.01.19.974	Her mother and father work for the government 
0026_00.01.19.974-00.01.21.510	alongside the head of Abnegation, Marcus Eaton.
0026_00.01.21.520-00.01.24.170	Beatrice also has a brother named Caleb.
0026_00.01.24.200-00.01.26.000	Beatrice takes her faction test,
0026_00.01.26.000-00.01.32.690	and it is revealed that she has equal attributes for multiple factions, which means she is considered "Divergent".
0026_00.01.32.710-00.01.35.101	She has traits for the selfless Abnegation,
0026_00.01.35.101-00.01.37.265	the intellectual Erudite,
0026_00.01.37.265-00.01.39.215	and the brave Dauntless.
0026_00.01.39.227-00.01.48.936	Beatrice's proctor tells her to keep these mixed results a secret, as the Divergent are considered uncontrollable threats to the government and are often eliminated.
0026_00.01.48.960-00.01.51.202	The next day at the Choosing Ceremony,
0026_00.01.51.202-00.01.55.683	Beatrice's brother Caleb chooses to go to join the intellectual Erudite
0026_00.01.55.683-00.01.58.080	and Beatrice chooses to join the Dauntless.
0026_00.01.58.090-00.02.00.443	Beatrice meets up with the other Dauntless initiates,
0026_00.02.00.443-00.02.02.350	where they travel to the Dauntless headquarters.
0026_00.02.02.360-00.02.08.784	After Beatrice arrives and performs a feat of bravery by jumping off a tall building into a pit,
0026_00.02.08.784-00.02.10.460	she decides to shorter name to just "Tris".
0026_00.02.10.470-00.02.15.126	Tris and the other initiates begin their training for becoming members of the Dauntless,
0026_00.02.15.126-00.02.17.900	which has become exceptionally grueling during the first phase.
0026_00.02.17.910-00.02.22.658	Only the best of the initiates will become members,
0026_00.02.22.658-00.02.25.010	and those that don't make it will become Factionless, essentially homeless.
0026_00.02.25.030-00.02.27.518	Tris make some friends amongst the initiates
0026_00.02.27.518-00.02.29.569	but also has some enemies,
0026_00.02.29.569-00.02.31.164	primarily an initiate named Peter,
0026_00.02.31.164-00.02.33.632	who even tries to kill her at one point.
0026_00.02.33.660-00.02.37.180	There are two senior Dauntless members that oversee their training.
0026_00.02.37.210-00.02.41.987	The first is Four, a tough but kind Dauntless who Tris develops feelings for;
0026_00.02.41.987-00.02.47.360	and the second is Eric, a brutal and ruthless leader of the Dauntless.
0026_00.02.47.370-00.02.52.582	Tris passes through the first phase of her training after winning a "capture the flag" game
0026_00.02.52.582-00.02.54.493	and moves on to the second phase,
0026_00.02.54.493-00.02.59.367	where initiates will undergo serum-induced simulations of their greatest fears.
0026_00.02.59.380-00.03.02.493	Tris, however, is able to breeze through the simulations
0026_00.03.02.493-00.03.04.400	drastically quicker than the other initiates.
0026_00.03.04.420-00.03.10.215	The reason is because she is a Divergent, and because she is a Divergent serums don't work the same for her
0026_00.03.10.215-00.03.12.520	as they do for other initiates.
0026_00.03.12.530-00.03.15.848	Four takes notice of this, however,
0026_00.03.15.848-00.03.20.790	and warns her that she needs to hide her powers so she isn't persecuted for being a Divergent.
0026_00.03.20.810-00.03.23.063	Four and Tris begin to develop a romantic relationship,
0026_00.03.23.063-00.03.26.822	and Four reveals that his real name is Tobias Eaton,
0026_00.03.26.822-00.03.29.772	and is the son of the leader of the Abnegation, Marcus Eaton,
0026_00.03.29.772-00.03.32.570	who used to abuse Four when he was much younger.
0026_00.03.32.580-00.03.35.531	Tris visits her brother Caleb,
0026_00.03.35.531-00.03.41.050	who informs her that Erudite is planning to overthrow Abnegation in order to take over the government.
0026_00.03.41.070-00.03.43.341	Tris returns the Dauntless headquarters,
0026_00.03.43.341-00.03.44.417	completes her final test,
0026_00.03.44.417-00.03.46.290	and becomes a full member of the Dauntless.
0026_00.03.46.310-00.03.52.210	Afterwards, all the Dauntless are given a new serum that they are told is for tracking purposes.
0026_00.03.52.235-00.03.54.315	However, it is really a mind control serum.
0026_00.03.54.350-00.03.58.632	The next day, the Dauntless are activated
0026_00.03.58.632-00.04.01.405	and the mind-controlled Dauntless are sent to attack and execute the Abnegation faction
0026_00.04.01.405-00.04.03.708	under the control of the leaders of the Dauntless
0026_00.04.03.708-00.04.05.410	and the Erudite.
0026_00.04.05.420-00.04.11.580	Tris and any other Divergent are unaffected by the serum, however, as their Divergent ways makes them immune to the effects of the serum.
0026_00.04.11.590-00.04.14.227	Tris, however, blends into the mind-controlled Dauntless
0026_00.04.14.227-00.04.19.530	and eventually discovers that Four is also a Divergent and isn't being controlled.
0026_00.04.19.530-00.04.22.075	The Dauntless arrive where the Abnegation are and begin killing innocent Abnegation faction members.
0026_00.04.22.075-00.04.26.000	and begin killing innocent Abnegation faction members.
0026_00.04.26.010-00.04.29.202	Tris and Four are found to be sentient, 
0026_00.04.29.202-00.04.32.658	and Four is put into custody by Eric, and Tris is ordered to be executed.
0026_00.04.32.680-00.04.35.189	Tris's mother, however, saves Tris,
0026_00.04.35.189-00.04.37.870	but eventually her mother is shot and killed.
0026_00.04.37.880-00.04.39.569	Tris finds her father,
0026_00.04.39.569-00.04.40.734	brother,
0026_00.04.40.734-00.04.42.210	and Four's father, Marcus.
0026_00.04.42.220-00.04.46.037	The group sneaks into the Dauntless headquarters
0026_00.04.46.037-00.04.49.139	and fights there several mind-controlled Dauntless members,
0026_00.04.49.139-00.04.51.341	including some initiates and friends she knew,
0026_00.04.51.354-00.04.54.911	Tris  encounters Peter, the rival initiate who tried to kill her.
0026_00.04.54.940-00.04.59.113	Peter is not mind-controlled, but Tris is able to defeat Peter
0026_00.04.59.113-00.05.05.088	and uses him to take them to the control room in order to deactivate the mind-controlled Dauntless.
0026_00.05.05.110-00.05.07.215	Tris's father is killed on the way
0026_00.05.07.215-00.05.08.974	and Tris travels in alone
0026_00.05.08.974-00.05.11.911	to find that Four is under the control of a much more powerful mind-control agent,
0026_00.05.11.911-00.05.15.670	and Four attacks Tris.
0026_00.05.15.690-00.05.17.670	Eventually, Tris is able to break Four's trance
0026_00.05.17.670-00.05.24.400	and they find that the leader of the Erudite, Jeanine, is going to have the Dauntless army execute all the Abnegation faction.
0026_00.05.24.430-00.05.26.987	They stop her
0026_00.05.26.987-00.05.31.320	and are able to deactivate all of the Dauntless, saving the Abnegation faction just in time.
0026_00.05.31.360-00.05.35.100	The group escapes the compound, knowing that war has only just begun.
0027_00.00.20.310-00.00.23.030	The film opens on a team of New York paranormal investigators, 
0027_00.00.23.030-00.00.26.330	called the Ghostbusters.
0027_00.00.26.330-00.00.27.450	The team consists of Peter Venkman,
0027_00.00.27.450-00.00.29.080	Raymond Stantz,
0027_00.00.29.080-00.00.30.410	Egon Spengler 
0027_00.00.30.410-00.00.33.240	and a new hire, Winston Zeddemore.
0027_00.00.33.240-00.00.35.990	The Ghostbusters use high-tech equipment to capture ghosts
0027_00.00.35.990-00.00.39.650	 and often cause a fair amount of destruction in the process.
0027_00.00.39.660-00.00.41.290	The Ghostbusters are hired by Dana Barrett,
0027_00.00.41.290-00.00.46.580	whose apartment has been haunted by a demonic spirit, named Zuul, 
0027_00.00.46.580-00.00.50.740	who is the servant to Gozer the Gozerian, the Sumerian God of Destruction.
0027_00.00.50.740-00.00.53.790	Venkman tries to win the affection of Dana, 
0027_00.00.53.790-00.00.57.530	however, he is also competing with Dana's neighbor, Lewis Tully.
0027_00.00.57.535-00.01.00.115	Dana is eventually possessed by Zuul,
0027_00.01.00.115-00.01.02.290	declaring herself the gatekeeper.
0027_00.01.02.290-00.01.04.450	Her neighbor, Lewis, is also possessed by another demon,
0027_00.01.04.450-00.01.07.100	declaring himself a key master.
0027_00.01.07.100-00.01.11.790	Both begin to talk about the coming of Gozer, so the Ghostbusters separate the two.
0027_00.01.11.795-00.01.19.825	While this is all going on, the Environmental Protection Agency has the Ghostbusters arrested for operating unlicensed waste handlers, 
0027_00.01.19.825-00.01.22.510	 as they are storing the captured ghosts in their facility.
0027_00.01.22.510-00.01.25.190	The EPA shuts down the containment system 
0027_00.01.25.190-00.01.30.250	and a massive explosion occurs and all the ghosts that the Ghostbusters have captured are set free
0027_00.01.30.250-00.01.33.440	and begin causing havoc throughout New York.
0027_00.01.33.445-00.01.36.615	The possessed Lewis and Dana are able to meet up
0027_00.01.36.615-00.01.40.665	and transform into demonic hounds and begin the process of summoning Gozer.
0027_00.01.40.670-00.01.46.540	In jail, the Ghostbusters discover that Dana's apartment was built by a cult leader, named Ivo Shandor, 
0027_00.01.46.540-00.01.52.370	who wanted to bring about the destruction of humanity and built the apartment as a conduit for summoning Gozer.
0027_00.01.52.375-00.01.54.705	The Ghostbusters are set free to fight the ghosts
0027_00.01.54.705-00.01.57.495	and travel to Dana's apartment's roof, 
0027_00.01.57.495-00.01.59.995	 but discover that Gozer has already arrived.
0027_00.01.59.995-00.02.00.995	The team are briefly able to stop Gozer, 
0027_00.02.00.995-00.02.02.755	who disappears
0027_00.02.02.755-00.02.07.915	and says that she will choose a new form that the team decides.
0027_00.02.07.920-00.02.10.370	They try to think of nothing, but Ray thinks of a corporate mascot from his childhood,
0027_00.02.10.370-00.02.13.730	 the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.
0027_00.02.13.730-00.02.18.570	Gozer reappears as a massive marshmallow man and begins attacking the city.
0027_00.02.18.570-00.02.24.170	The Ghostbusters take their energy streams and cross the stream, firing at Gozer's portal.
0027_00.02.24.190-00.02.26.330	This defeats Gozer
0027_00.02.26.330-00.02.28.410	and frees Dana and Lewis.
0027_00.02.28.420-00.02.30.790	Though covered in marshmallow fluff,
0027_00.02.30.790-00.02.34.620	the Ghostbusters are treated as heroes for saving the city of New York.
0028_00.00.31.660-00.00.39.785	This film is littered with references to the original films, with many of the original cast showing up as other characters and other various cameos.
0028_00.00.39.785-00.00.43.365	The movie opens with physicist Erin Gilbert 
0028_00.00.43.365-00.00.45.615	learning her research book on the existence of paranormal phenomena,
0028_00.00.45.615-00.00.48.105	co-authored with fellow physicist Abby Yates
0028_00.00.48.105-00.00.50.290	has been republished by Abby.
0028_00.00.50.290-00.00.53.950	This though ends Erin's bid for tenure at Columbia University.
0028_00.00.53.950-00.00.56.660	Erin confronts Abby,
0028_00.00.56.660-00.01.00.600	who is continuing to study the paranormal at a technical college
0028_00.01.00.600-00.01.02.080	with engineer Jillian Holtzman.
0028_00.01.02.090-00.01.09.370	In exchange for Abby removing the book from publication, Erin reluctantly agrees to assist her and Jillian
0028_00.01.09.370-00.01.11.730	in a paranormal investigation of a presumed haunted building
0028_00.01.11.730-00.01.16.100	where they witness and film a ghost, 
0028_00.01.16.100-00.01.16.990	 renewing Erin's belief in the paranormal.
0028_00.01.16.995-00.01.18.525	However, when the video of their investigation is posted online,
0028_00.01.18.525-00.01.21.535	Erin is denied her tenured
0028_00.01.21.535-00.01.24.410	and Abby and Jillian are also fired.
0028_00.01.24.410-00.01.29.120	Erin, Abby and Jillian open their own ghost-busting business
0028_00.01.29.120-00.01.33.410	and open an office above a Chinese restaurant
0028_00.01.33.410-00.01.35.120	and hire dim-witted, but handsome Kevin Beckman as a receptionist.
0028_00.01.35.120-00.01.36.320	A MTA worker named Patty Tolan, 
0028_00.01.36.320-00.01.39.290	witnesses a ghost in a subway line
0028_00.01.39.290-00.01.40.990	and contacts the group.
0028_00.01.40.995-00.01.45.665	They film the ghost and successfully test Jillian's proton containment laser, 
0028_00.01.45.665-00.01.48.445	but the video is again dismissed as a hoax.
0028_00.01.48.445-00.01.50.825	Patty joins the team, 
0028_00.01.50.825-00.01.55.410	providing a repurposed hearse from her grandfather, similar to the Echo One from the original films.
0028_00.01.55.410-00.02.05.290	Soon it is learned that the ghosts are being summoned by devices built by Rowan North, an occultist and a mad scientist, attempting to bring about the apocalypse.
0028_00.02.05.295-00.02.08.025	The Ghostbusters are brought to see the mayor who reveals that the city
0028_00.02.08.025-00.02.09.115	and the Department of Homeland Security 
0028_00.02.09.115-00.02.15.330	 are aware of New York's ghost problem, which is very different than the original films.
0028_00.02.15.330-00.02.17.240	While privately supporting the team's work,
0028_00.02.17.240-00.02.20.540	 the mayor's office publicly denounced them as fraudsters.
0028_00.02.20.540-00.02.27.100	The Ghostbusters discover Rowan building a portal to the ghost dimension in the hotel basement.
0028_00.02.27.105-00.02.29.995	To avoid capture, Rowan deliberately electrocutes himself to death, 
0028_00.02.29.995-00.02.32.275	after which Jillian deactivates the portal 
0028_00.02.32.275-00.02.36.325	and realizes that he killed himself so that he could become a ghost
0028_00.02.36.325-00.02.38.945	and command a spirit army.
0028_00.02.38.955-00.02.40.065	Rowan returns as a powerful ghost,
0028_00.02.40.065-00.02.43.080	ultimately possessing Kevin, the receptionist.
0028_00.02.43.080-00.02.47.740	As Kevin, he opens the portal and releases hundreds of ghosts.
0028_00.02.47.750-00.02.51.200	The police and DHS are quickly subdued
0028_00.02.51.200-00.02.55.040	but the Ghostbusters fight through the army of ghosts to reach the portal.
0028_00.02.55.050-00.03.00.800	Rowan takes the form of a ghost, grows to enormous height and attacks the city.
0028_00.03.00.800-00.03.02.360	The team devises a plan
0028_00.03.02.360-00.03.04.900	 to use a nuclear reactor to close the portal
0028_00.03.04.900-00.03.07.620	and return the ghosts to their own dimension.
0028_00.03.07.620-00.03.09.620	The plan succeeds
0028_00.03.09.620-00.03.11.150	but Rowan drags Abby into the portal with him.
0028_00.03.11.160-00.03.12.410	Erin leaps into the portal
0028_00.03.12.410-00.03.14.660	and rescues her.
0028_00.03.14.660-00.03.23.680	After the city is saved, the mayor's office agrees to secretly fund the Ghostbusters' research while continuing to publicly denounce them as frauds,
0028_00.03.23.680-00.03.24.330	UNMATCHED:  however, New York lights up with thanks and tributes to the Ghostbusters.
0028_00.03.24.335-00.03.30.435	UNMATCHED
0028_00.03.30.435-00.03.32.245	With new funding, the Ghostbusters move to a better facility,
0028_00.03.32.245-00.03.36.625	an unoccupied firehouse, the same one from the original film.
0028_00.03.36.625-00.03.43.915	In a post-credits scene, Patty listens to a recording of a ghost encounter and asks the others
0028_00.03.43.915-00.03.47.665	 if they've ever heard of Zuul, the main ghost terrorizing New York in the first film.
0029_00.00.28.655-00.00.36.195	The film takes place five years after the events of the previous film and the Ghostbusters have gone their separate ways
0029_00.00.36.195-00.00.38.405	after being sued for property damage that occurred through the events of the first film,
0029_00.00.38.405-00.00.40.705	causing them to go out of business.
0029_00.00.40.705-00.00.43.615	Dana, who has had a baby named Oscar,
0029_00.00.43.615-00.00.45.665	now works as an art restorer, 
0029_00.00.45.665-00.00.49.200	working on a portrait of the 16th century tyrant named Vigo.
0029_00.00.49.200-00.00.53.320	After an incident with Oscar's baby carriage that seemed supernatural, 
0029_00.00.53.320-00.00.55.945	Dana contacts the Ghostbusters.
0029_00.00.55.945-00.01.02.585	Meanwhile, one of Dana's colleagues, Dr. Janosz Poha, becomes increasingly interested in the painting of Vigo
0029_00.01.02.585-00.01.04.505	and we see that Janosz is under the spell of the painting.
0029_00.01.04.510-00.01.08.660	Vigo's spirit is within the painting 
0029_00.01.08.660-00.01.12.900	and needs to possess a child so that he can return to life by the New Year.
0029_00.01.12.905-00.01.15.535	The Ghostbusters begin to investigate 
0029_00.01.15.535-00.01.18.085	and discover a river of pink slime underneath the city of New York.
0029_00.01.18.085-00.01.22.025	The Ghostbusters inadvertantly cause a citywide blackout 
0029_00.01.22.025-00.01.25.355	and are subsequently arrested and taken to court.
0029_00.01.25.355-00.01.27.315	After being found guilty,
0029_00.01.27.315-00.01.30.120	the courtroom is attacked by ghosts.
0029_00.01.30.120-00.01.32.990	The Ghostbusters capture the ghosts
0029_00.01.32.990-00.01.35.360	and charges are dismissed and they are allowed to reopen their business of ghost catching.
0029_00.01.35.370-00.01.40.280	The pink slime invades Dana's apartment and attacks both her and Oscar.
0029_00.01.40.280-00.01.45.720	The Ghostbusters discover that the slime can react to different emotions, both positive and negative
0029_00.01.45.720-00.01.49.960	and they believe that the slime is a result of negative attitudes of New York citizens.
0029_00.01.49.960-00.01.51.730	Dana's son, Oscar, 
0029_00.01.51.730-00.01.54.850	is kidnapped by a spirit that looks very much like Janosz
0029_00.01.54.850-00.01.56.320	and by New Year's Eve, the pink slime is flooding the streets, 
0029_00.01.56.320-00.02.00.240	causing widespread paranormal activity.
0029_00.02.00.240-00.02.03.950	The Ghostbusters try to get into the slime-covered museum, but are unsuccessful.
0029_00.02.03.950-00.02.09.240	The Ghostbusters then utilize the slime's ability to react to positive energy and use a remixed version of the song, Higher and Higher, 
0029_00.02.09.240-00.02.15.450	in order to animate the Statue of Liberty,
0029_00.02.15.450-00.02.17.580	which gets the on-looking citizens excited and happy, increasing the positive mood.
0029_00.02.17.580-00.02.22.420	They use the torch on the Statue of Liberty to break into the museum
0029_00.02.22.420-00.02.27.330	 in order to fight Janosz and the spirit of Vigo.
0029_00.02.27.330-00.02.28.660	Vigo tries to transfer his spirit into Oscar,
0029_00.02.28.660-00.02.31.040	but the crowd outside singing weakens him,
0029_00.02.31.040-00.02.33.320	returning him back into the painting.
0029_00.02.33.320-00.02.36.700	For a moment, Vigo possesses Ray,
0029_00.02.36.700-00.02.40.300	 but the Ghostbusters shoot him with the proton streams as well as the positively charged mood slime.
0029_00.02.40.300-00.02.42.910	Vigo is destroyed
0029_00.02.42.910-00.02.46.360	and his painting is changed to show the Ghostbusters protecting Oscar.
0029_00.02.46.365-00.02.50.745	Outside of the museum, the Ghostbusters receive a standing ovation, 
0029_00.02.50.745-00.02.53.665	and later on they receive the key to the city from the mayor.
0030_00.00.17.490-00.00.25.830	The film opens in 1999 with scientists investigating a colossal skeleton unearthed in a collapsed mine in the Philippines.
0030_00.00.25.835-00.00.27.165	They find two giant spores, one dormant
0030_00.00.27.165-00.00.29.730	and one hatched, with a trail leading out to sea.
0030_00.00.29.730-00.00.34.200	In Japan, a nuclear power plant experiences an unusual seismic activity
0030_00.00.34.200-00.00.36.155	and it is destroyed.
0030_00.00.36.155-00.00.39.365	Supervisor Joe Brody
0030_00.00.39.365-00.00.41.405	loses his wife in the reactor breach.
0030_00.00.41.410-00.00.44.660	15 years later, Joe's son, Ford, a US Navy explosive expert
0030_00.00.44.660-00.00.47.240	must depart for Japan
0030_00.00.47.240-00.00.49.330	after his father is detained
0030_00.00.49.330-00.00.51.070	for trespassing into the quarantine zone.
0030_00.00.51.080-00.00.55.670	Joe persuades Ford to accompany him to their old home in the quarantine zone to retrieve vital data.
0030_00.00.55.670-00.00.57.800	They successfully retrieve the data
0030_00.00.57.800-00.01.00.580	but are discovered by soldiers 
0030_00.01.00.580-00.01.02.750	 and taken to a secret facility in the power plant's ruins.
0030_00.01.02.755-00.01.04.985	After several power failures, 
0030_00.01.04.985-00.01.06.995	a giant winged creature emerges and escapes, 
0030_00.01.06.995-00.01.09.530	 destroying the facility.
0030_00.01.09.530-00.01.12.910	Joe is severely wounded and dies.
0030_00.01.12.910-00.01.14.640	The incident is reported around the world as just an earthquake.
0030_00.01.14.650-00.01.18.730	Ford joins the search for the creature,
0030_00.01.18.730-00.01.21.450	named a MUTO, or a massive unidentified terrestrial organism.
0030_00.01.21.455-00.01.26.275	It is revealed to Ford that in 1954, a deep sea expedition triggered the appearance of Godzilla,
0030_00.01.26.275-00.01.29.580	a massive lizard monster, 
0030_00.01.29.587-00.01.31.997	who they believe preys on the MUTO's.
0030_00.01.31.997-00.01.36.450	Ford reveals that Joe had monitored echolocation signals 
0030_00.01.36.458-00.01.39.795	that indicated the MUTO was communicating with something, most likely a second MUTO.
0030_00.01.39.795-00.01.45.955	MUTO's feed off nuclear energy and the MUTO attacks a Russian submarine
0030_00.01.45.955-00.01.47.955	and drops it into land in Hawaii to eat the sub's nuclear material.
0030_00.01.47.955-00.01.50.995	Godzilla arrives, causing a tsunami in Honolulu
0030_00.01.50.995-00.01.52.665	and briefly engages the MUTO in battle
0030_00.01.52.665-00.01.55.370	until it flees.
0030_00.01.55.370-00.01.59.870	Meanwhile, a second larger, wingless MUTO emerges from the other spore in Nevada
0030_00.01.59.870-00.02.01.740	 and devastates Las Vegas.
0030_00.02.01.745-00.02.04.455	The scientists deduce that the second MUTO is female
0030_00.02.04.455-00.02.08.240	and the two MUTO's will breed in San Francisco.
0030_00.02.08.240-00.02.10.535	Nuclear warheads are used to lure and destroy the monsters.
0030_00.02.10.535-00.02.16.355	Ford returns to the U.S. and joins the team delivering the warheads by train, 
0030_00.02.16.355-00.02.20.705	but the female MUTO intercepts the train and devours most of the warheads.
0030_00.02.20.705-00.02.27.155	A single warhead is remaining and is airlifted with Ford to San Francisco, 
0030_00.02.27.155-00.02.31.080	to be activated after a confrontation between the military and Godzilla at the Golden Gate Bridge.
0030_00.02.31.080-00.02.34.830	The male MUTO steals the warhead and takes it to the female,
0030_00.02.34.830-00.02.39.445	who forms a nest around it in the Chinatown area.
0030_00.02.39.445-00.02.40.035	UNMATCHED: While Godzilla and the MUTO's battle,
0030_00.02.40.035-00.02.43.490	a strike team, including Ford, enters the city to find and disarm the warhead.
0030_00.02.43.490-00.02.45.650	Unable to access the timer,
0030_00.02.45.650-00.02.48.220	 the rest of the team sets the warhead on a boat for disposal at sea.
0030_00.02.48.225-00.02.51.745	The MUTO's are eventually able to get the upper hand, 
0030_00.02.51.745-00.02.54.285	but Ford blows up the MUTO nest, 
0030_00.02.54.285-00.03.00.080	 ultimately distracting the MUTO's long enough for Godzilla to emerge victorious, killing both the MUTO's.
0030_00.03.00.080-00.03.03.360	Godzilla then collapses on the city shore.
0030_00.03.03.360-00.03.05.780	WIth the rest of the team wiped out, 
0030_00.03.05.780-00.03.08.970	Ford uses the last of his energy to get the boat with the warhead out to sea.
0030_00.03.08.970-00.03.11.160	He is rescued just before the warhead explodes
0030_00.03.11.160-00.03.13.580	and reunites with his family the following morning.
0030_00.03.13.585-00.03.16.325	Godzilla awakens,
0030_00.03.16.325-00.03.18.145	rising up from the destroyed San Francisco, 
0030_00.03.18.145-00.03.20.125	and returns to sea.
0031_00.00.17.400-00.00.22.510	Peter Jason Quill, aka Starlord.
0031_00.00.22.515-00.00.24.605	Shortly after his mother's death in 1988, 
0031_00.00.24.605-00.00.26.315	he is kidnapped
0031_00.00.26.315-00.00.30.150	and raised by a group of space pirates, known as the Ravagers.
0031_00.00.30.150-00.00.39.445	The film opens on Peter stealing an orb, which takes place 26 years after his abduction.
0031_00.00.39.445-00.00.42.745	Peter is a goofy and charismatic smuggler who is a bit of a jerk at times 
0031_00.00.42.745-00.00.45.870	 and doesn't have any trouble with the ladies.
0031_00.00.45.870-00.00.46.500	Remind you of anyone?
0031_00.00.46.500-00.00.47.630	Yondu.
0031_00.00.47.630-00.00.52.260	Yondu is the leader of the Ravagers, a group of ruthless space theives and smugglers.
0031_00.00.52.260-00.00.58.390	Yondu raised Peter after abducting him, bringing him into the life of space crime.
0031_00.00.58.390-00.01.03.850	Yondu carries a special arrow on his hip that he can control by simply whistling,
0031_00.01.03.850-00.01.07.675	working as a verry effective and deadly weapon.
0031_00.01.07.675-00.01.13.275	After hearing that Peter stole the orb in the opening of the movie,
0031_00.01.13.275-00.01.17.345	Yondu places a bounty on Peter's head in order to steal the orb for himself.

0031_00.01.31.160-00.01.33.920	which is also the same planet where Peter intends to sell the orb that he stole.

0031_00.01.48.105-00.01.51.290	and is hell-bent on destroying the planet, Xandar.
0031_00.01.51.290-00.01.55.270	Ronan wants the orb so he can trade it to Thanos, 
0031_00.01.55.270-00.01.58.240	 in order to receive Thanos' aid in the destruction of Xandar.
0031_00.01.58.245-00.02.02.605	Ronan's primary weapon is a large hammer
0031_00.02.02.605-00.02.07.580	and he also has his own ship, known as the Dark Aster,

0031_00.02.53.880-00.02.55.670	and Groot.
0031_00.02.55.670-00.02.59.920	Rocket Raccoon is the result of illegal genetic experimentation, 
0031_00.02.59.920-00.03.03.720	resulting in Rocket being a very intelligent and skilled fighter 
0031_00.03.03.720-00.03.07.680	and is also capable of designing complex weapons and technology.
0031_00.03.07.680-00.03.12.300	Groot is a tree-like creature

0031_00.03.30.290-00.03.34.535	Drax the Destroyer.
0031_00.03.34.535-00.03.37.215	Drax is an incredibly powerful and strong fighter, 
0031_00.03.37.215-00.03.44.750	 but he is completely literal and has no understanding of euphemisms, social cues, or satire.
0031_00.03.44.750-00.03.49.550	Drax's entire family was killed by Ronan and vows to get revenge.
0031_00.03.49.550-00.03.51.880	UNMATCHED: And now, on to the story.
0031_00.03.51.880-00.03.58.480	After stealing the orb, Peter lands on the planet, Xandar, in order to sell the orb to his black market dealer.

0031_00.03.59.340-00.04.03.270	who wants to steal the orb for herself.

0031_00.04.07.835-00.04.12.040	when Groot and Rocket identify Peter and notice that he has a bounty on his head.
0031_00.04.12.040-00.04.16.550	Groot and Rocket jump into the fight in order to capture Peter themselves.
0031_00.04.16.560-00.04.20.550	After causing a considerable amount of damage,
0031_00.04.20.550-00.04.21.920	 all four of them are arrested
0031_00.04.21.920-00.04.26.430	and sent to the Klyn, a high-security outer space prison.
0031_00.04.26.440-00.04.32.300	When they arrive at the Klyn, Gamora explains to the group that she was going to sell the orb for a massive amount of money.
0031_00.04.32.300-00.04.39.980	After a bit of arguing, Peter convinces the team to work together to break out of the prison and split the earnings from selling the orb.
0031_00.04.39.990-00.04.43.780	While in prison, they meet Drax, 
0031_00.04.43.780-00.04.45.530	whose entire family was killed by Ronan and wants revenge.
0031_00.04.45.530-00.04.50.530	Drax teams up with the main group in hopes that he will have the opportunity to kill Ronan.
0031_00.04.50.535-00.04.54.455	The team devises an elaborate plan,
0031_00.04.54.455-00.04.56.910	involving disabling the gravity of the prison, and successfuly escapes.
0031_00.04.56.910-00.05.03.550	Afterwards, they travel to meet Gamora's buyer on a massive floating head, known as Knowhere.
0031_00.05.03.550-00.05.07.590	Knowhere is a seedy mining community with virtually no laws.
0031_00.05.07.590-00.05.13.050	Peter and Gamora meet up with the collector there, who reveals to them the true purpose of the orb:
0031_00.05.13.050-00.05.32.570	"Oh my new friends, before creation itself, there were six singularities, then the universe exploded into existence and the remnants of the system were forged into concentrated ingots."
0031_00.05.32.570-00.05.36.080	The infinity stone.
0031_00.05.36.080-00.05.42.420	The infinity stone contains a massive amount of energy and can only be wielded by beings of superior power,
0031_00.05.42.420-00.05.45.470	however, one of the slaves tries to take the stone in defiance of him
0031_00.05.45.470-00.05.48.370	and explodes on contact.
0031_00.05.48.370-00.05.57.725	After realizing the stone's importance, Gamora and Peter decide to take the stone to the Nova Corps so it could be kept out of the hands of dangerous individuals, such as Ronan.
0031_00.05.57.725-00.05.58.645	UNMATCHED: But while Peter and Gamora were dealing with the stone and the collector, 
0031_00.05.58.645-00.06.05.270	Drax made contact with Ronan in a foolish attempt to kill him.
0031_00.06.05.270-00.06.09.400	Ronan arrives on Knowhere with his entire fleet 
0031_00.06.09.400-00.06.14.720	 and at the same time, Yondu has tracked down Peter's location and a huge fight breaks out between all three sides.
0031_00.06.14.730-00.06.18.400	After a lot of shooting, flying and chasing, 
0031_00.06.18.400-00.06.20.630	eventually the team is defeated
0031_00.06.20.630-00.06.23.240	and they lose the stone to Ronan.
0031_00.06.23.240-00.06.28.050	Gamora and Peter are left stranded, floating in outer space, with only seconds to live.
0031_00.06.28.050-00.06.31.880	In a moment of desperation, Peter reaches out to Yondu, 
0031_00.06.31.880-00.06.35.140	who ends up saving them from the cold and oxygenless space.
0031_00.06.35.145-00.06.38.185	Aboard the Dark Aster,
0031_00.06.38.185-00.06.43.395	Ronan, who has now realized what the orb actually contained, decides to take the infinity stone for himself 
0031_00.06.43.395-00.06.46.400	and places it into his hammer.
0031_00.06.46.400-00.06.47.170	UNMATCHED: Thanos is furious at Ronan's betrayal,
0031_00.06.47.170-00.06.55.370	but Ronan vows that he will destroy the planet, Xandar, and afterwards he will go kill Thanos.
0031_00.06.55.375-00.06.58.115	We now go back to Yondu's ship,
0031_00.06.58.115-00.07.03.450	where shortly after recovering from the oxygenless space, Peter and Gamora are interrogated by Yondu.
0031_00.07.03.450-00.07.05.870	After some threatening and fighting, 
0031_00.07.05.870-00.07.14.100	Peter convinces Yondu and the Ravagers to team up with the Guardians in order to get the stone back from Ronan.
0031_00.07.14.100-00.07.18.390	The deal is Yondu and his men will help the Guardians
0031_00.07.18.390-00.07.19.675	 so long as Yondu gets the infinity stone when the battle is over.
0031_00.07.19.675-00.07.22.885	Peter contacts the Nova Corps on Xandar
0031_00.07.22.885-00.07.28.890	 to alert them of Ronan's attack and also to let them know that the Ravagers will be helping protect the planet.
0031_00.07.28.890-00.07.32.450	Ronan's ship arrives at the planet, Xandar,
0031_00.07.32.450-00.07.36.360	along with a massive fleet of Kree fighter ships.
0031_00.07.36.360-00.07.38.080	While the Ravagers and the Nova Corps fight the fleet from the outside, 
0031_00.07.38.080-00.07.41.500	 Peter, Drax, Groot and Gamora punch a hole in the Dark Aster
0031_00.07.41.505-00.07.43.710	 and enter in on foot.
0031_00.07.43.710-00.07.47.340	Rocket, on the other hand, remains on the outside of the Dark Aster
0031_00.07.47.340-00.07.49.800	 in order to help fight from his ship.
0031_00.07.49.800-00.07.56.010	The Guardians fight their way through the inside, defeating Nebula and Ronan's soldiers.
0031_00.07.56.015-00.07.58.465	Eventually, the Guardians reach Ronan, 
0031_00.07.58.465-00.08.01.645	but Ronan, coupled with the power of the infinity stone,
0031_00.08.01.645-00.08.03.950	clearly has the upper hand.
0031_00.08.03.950-00.08.09.820	It seems as though all hope is lost for the Guardians, however, while monologuing about his superior power, 
0031_00.08.09.820-00.08.12.860	Rocket crashes his ship through a window, hitting Ronan,
0031_00.08.12.860-00.08.15.510	and causing the Dark Aster to fall out of the sky.
0031_00.08.15.515-00.08.17.655	As the Dark Aster is plummeting to Earth, 
0031_00.08.17.655-00.08.23.790	Groot creates a protective wood ball around the group which will kill him, but protect the others.
0031_00.08.23.790-00.08.24.660	After the ship crashes,
0031_00.08.24.660-00.08.29.740	 a huge wave of destruction occurs, crushing buildings and a good portion of the city.
0031_00.08.29.740-00.08.33.470	The group has survived, except for Groot,
0031_00.08.33.470-00.08.35.420	but unfortunately, so did Ronan.
0031_00.08.35.425-00.08.37.415	Once again, Ronan, being the high and mighty fanatic, 
0031_00.08.37.415-00.08.46.060	starts monologuing about how he will destroy Xandar.
0031_00.08.46.060-00.08.48.360	Peter sees this as a great opportunity to create a distraction.
0031_00.08.48.360-00.08.49.960	Ooh child, things are gonna get easier.
0031_00.08.49.960-00.08.54.225	Ooh child, things will get brighter.
0031_00.08.54.230-00.08.55.530	Listen to these words.

0031_00.09.00.850-00.09.04.460	Ooh child, things are gonna get brighter.
0031_00.09.04.460-00.09.06.380	Now bring it down hard.
0031_00.09.06.380-00.09.08.250	Someday, we'll get it together and we'll get it all done.
0031_00.09.08.250-00.09.10.800	What are you doing?
0031_00.09.10.800-00.09.16.790	Dance-off bro, me and you.
0031_00.09.16.790-00.09.19.620	Gamora.
0031_00.09.19.620-00.09.22.090	Subtle, take it back.
0031_00.09.22.090-00.09.24.480	What are you doing?
0031_00.09.24.480-00.09.28.800	I'm distracting ya, you big turd blossom.

0031_00.09.45.955-00.09.53.965	and the Guardians all work together to utilize the power of the infinity stone
0031_00.09.53.965-00.09.56.000	and finally defeat Ronan.
0031_00.09.56.000-00.10.00.850	You said it yourself bitch, we're the Guardians of the Galaxy.
0031_00.10.00.850-00.10.20.350	UNMATCHED
0031_00.10.20.350-00.10.23.410	After Ronan is destroyed, the Guardians trap the stone in a container,
0031_00.10.23.410-00.10.27.320	 only to be immediately surrounded by Yondu and the Ravagers.
0031_00.10.27.320-00.10.29.920	Yondu takes the container and leaves the Guardians.
0031_00.10.29.925-00.10.32.585	As Yondu is leaving,
0031_00.10.32.585-00.10.39.260	he mentions to one of his crew how the Ravagers were originally hired to pick up Peter and bring Peter to his Dad.
0031_00.10.39.260-00.10.39.750	UNMATCHED:  This possibly could be a plot point for the next movie.
0031_00.10.39.755-00.10.44.375	Peter reveals, however, that he switched the container on Yondu,
0031_00.10.44.375-00.10.46.395	giving Yondu a troll doll, 
0031_00.10.46.395-00.10.51.290	while giving the real infinity stone to the Nova Corps to be locked away and protected.
0031_00.10.51.290-00.10.57.570	As a reward for their service, the Nova Corps expunges all of the Guardians' criminal records.
0031_00.10.57.570-00.11.01.100	Aboard the ship, we see that a small twig from Groot, that Rocket had saved, 
0031_00.11.01.100-00.11.06.200	actually turned out to still be alive, indicating that we will most likely see Groot again.
0031_00.11.06.200-00.11.10.530	The Guardians fly off to start on some other new adventure.
0031_00.11.10.530-00.11.16.900	After the credits, on Knowhere, we see the collector, still damaged and hurt from earlier, 
0031_00.11.16.900-00.11.21.660	being taunted by Howard the Duck.
0031_00.11.21.660-00.11.22.390	UNMATCHED:  To my understanding at this time, there is no plan for an actual Howard the Duck movie.
0031_00.11.22.390-00.11.23.270	UNMATCHED:  I think it was just a fun and goofy little thing they decided to add in.
0032_00.00.27.705-00.00.29.745	The film opens with Voldemort gaining strength
0032_00.00.29.745-00.00.31.455	after Dumbledore's death,

0032_00.00.56.865-00.00.58.245	and Harry's owl, Hedwig,

0032_00.01.03.165-00.01.05.620	for information on a mystical wand.
0032_00.01.05.620-00.01.11.370	The next day, the Minister of Magic arrives to reuse Dumbledore's will and presents them with a Deluminator,
0032_00.01.11.370-00.01.13.440	a book called The Tales of Beedle the Bard,
0032_00.01.13.440-00.01.16.620	and Harry's first Golden Snitch that he ever caught.
0032_00.01.16.630-00.01.20.450	The minister also states that Harry is to be given the sword of Godric Griffindor, 
0032_00.01.20.450-00.01.25.580	however, he states that it wasn't Dumbledore's to give and also the sword is missing.

0032_00.01.28.665-00.01.30.410	and replaced by a new puppet minister.
0032_00.01.30.410-00.01.32.730	Muggle-born witches and wizards are arrested 
0032_00.01.32.730-00.01.35.990	and rather racist and totalitarian laws are put into place.

0032_00.01.49.180-00.01.54.780	They find out that a shady member of the Order of the Phoenix, named Mundungus, stole the real Horcrux locket.
0032_00.01.54.785-00.01.57.165	Mundungus is captured by two house elves
0032_00.01.57.165-00.02.04.995	and he reveals that the locket was taken by Dolores Umbridge, the former professor seen in the fifth film.
0032_00.02.04.995-00.02.07.245	Using Polyjuice Potions,

0032_00.02.16.050-00.02.20.700	The locket curses whoever wears it to become angry, depressed and paranoid,
0032_00.02.20.700-00.02.23.130	UNMATCHED:  almost like the ring from Lord of the Ring, 
0032_00.02.23.130-00.02.24.540	so they try to take turns wearing the locket.
0032_00.02.24.540-00.02.28.190	Ron becomes particularly upset after wearing the locket
0032_00.02.28.190-00.02.29.200	UNMATCHED:  and leaves Hermione and Harry.
0032_00.02.29.205-00.02.33.035	Hermione decides that because it is coded in basilisk blood,

0033_00.01.44.000-00.01.47.570	Even though it was in self-defense, Tris has been haunted by the killings of her mind-controlled friends.

0035_00.00.43.570-00.00.44.910	and brings it home.
0035_00.00.44.910-00.00.48.445	Sarah, his friend, arrives and they begin playing Jumanji.
0035_00.00.48.445-00.00.53.855	With each roll of the dice, the player pieces move by themselves
0035_00.00.53.855-00.00.58.070	and a cryptic message describing the roll's outcome appears in the crystal ball at the center of the board.

0035_00.01.12.360-00.01.13.830	and chase Sarah out of the mansion.

0036_00.00.12.900-00.00.22.920	The movie begins with a nearly complete theme park filled with live, clone dinosaurs, known as Jurassic Park, 
0036_00.00.22.920-00.00.26.030	created by the company InGen, whose CEO and founder is John Hammond.
0036_00.00.26.030-00.00.30.610	The park is located on Isla Nublar, an island off of Costa Rica.
0036_00.00.30.615-00.00.33.825	After an incident at the park where a worker is killed by a velociraptor, 
0036_00.00.33.825-00.00.38.935	Donald Gennaro, a lawyer representing the investors of the park,
0036_00.00.38.935-00.00.41.240	demands to have experts be brought in to assess the safety.
0036_00.00.41.240-00.00.45.900	They bring in Dr. Alan Grant, paleontologist, 
0036_00.00.45.900-00.00.48.350	Dr. Ellie Sattler, a paleobotanist,
0036_00.00.48.350-00.00.52.740	and Ian Malcolm, a mathematician, 
0036_00.00.52.740-00.00.55.910	who are all blown away by the dinosaurs and the plant life the park has to offer.
0036_00.00.55.915-00.01.01.355	The group learns that the clone dinosaurs
0036_00.01.01.355-00.01.02.055	are a result of extracting DNA in blood found in mosquitoes
0036_00.01.02.055-00.01.04.150	 that have been preserved in amber.
0036_00.01.04.150-00.01.10.360	The strand is often incomplete, so the DNA from frogs is used to fill in the gaps.
0036_00.01.10.370-00.01.13.270	As a safety precaution, all the clones are selected to be female to prevent breeding.
0036_00.01.13.270-00.01.20.330	Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex Murphy, are also brought to the park to see if it is actually fun for children.

0036_00.01.23.815-00.01.26.370	while Hammond stays back in the control room to oversee the trip.

0036_00.01.31.290-00.01.38.780	Later, a storm hits the island and cuts the tour short and the group is supposed to be brought back to the welcome area where they started the tour.
0036_00.01.38.780-00.01.43.360	While this is all going on, Nedry, a computer programmer that works on the island,
0036_00.01.43.360-00.01.46.100	deactivates the security system
0036_00.01.46.100-00.01.48.430	so he can steal a clone dinosaur embryo, 
0036_00.01.48.430-00.01.52.210	which he intends to sell to a competitor of InGen.
0036_00.01.52.215-00.01.58.475	However, in deactivating the security system, he takes out the entire power grid, which deactivates the security fences around the dinosaurs
0036_00.01.58.475-00.02.04.555	as well as stops the tour vehicles, leaving the group stranded at night, in a storm, amongst the dinosaurs.
0036_00.02.04.555-00.02.09.315	A Tyrannosaurus Rex escapes and chases the group
0036_00.02.09.315-00.02.13.535	and catches the lawyer, Gennaro, as he's sitting on the toilet.
0036_00.02.13.540-00.02.17.785	As Nedry tries to escape, he becomes lost in the storm and is killed by a dilophosaurus.
0036_00.02.17.785-00.02.22.765	Dr. Sattler and the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, go searching for survivors 
0036_00.02.22.765-00.02.24.640	 but only find Malcolm.
0036_00.02.24.640-00.02.31.300	Unable to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer, Ray Arnold, decide to reboot the system.
0036_00.02.31.305-00.02.35.785	The group at the Visitors Center goes to the emergency bunker
0036_00.02.35.785-00.02.38.140	while Arnold goes to the maintenance shed to reboot the system.
0036_00.02.38.140-00.02.41.055	However, he does not return, so Dr Sattler and Muldoon travel to the shed themselves.
0036_00.02.41.060-00.02.47.980	Sattler heads into the shed to restart the power,
0036_00.02.47.980-00.02.58.530	while Muldoon attempts to fight the raptors outside and is ambushed and delivers the famous "Clever girl" line,
0036_00.02.58.530-00.03.04.260	and is killed.
0036_00.03.04.260-00.03.12.340	Meanwhile, Dr. Grant and Hammond's grandchildren discover broken shells of dinosaur eggs, which indicates that the dinosaurs have been reproducing.
0036_00.03.12.350-00.03.13.500	UNMATCHED: Dr. Grant reasons that it's because of some portion of frog DNA that the dinosaurs probably have where some frogs are able to change sex in certain environments.  
0036_00.03.13.500-00.03.22.290	UNMATCHED
0036_00.03.22.300-00.03.27.470	The three of them travel back to the Visitor Center to meet up with the others, 
0036_00.03.27.470-00.03.31.640	where they are chased by velociraptors.
0036_00.03.31.640-00.03.35.480	When all hope is lost and they are cornered by the raptors, a Tyrannosaurus Rex appears and kills the raptors.
0036_00.03.35.480-00.03.42.650	The group escapes on a helicopter 
0036_00.03.42.650-00.03.43.510	UNMATCHED:  and Grant informs Hammond that he does not endorse the park to which Hammond agrees.
0037_00.00.16.510-00.00.23.280	The film opens on two tourists, Ben Hildebrand and Eric Kirby, who are parasailing
0037_00.00.23.280-00.00.26.430	 around the dinosaur island of Isla Sorna, the island from the second film.
0037_00.00.26.430-00.00.31.120	Their boat is attacked and everyone aboard is killed, while Ben and Eric are still parasailing.
0037_00.00.31.120-00.00.34.060	They detach from the boat and sail into the island.
0037_00.00.34.065-00.00.37.555	The movie shifts to showing several of the characters from the first film,
0037_00.00.37.555-00.00.42.305	including Dr. Grant, who is famous for the events taking place in the original Jurassic Park, 
0037_00.00.42.305-00.00.44.435	as well as Dr. Sattler, 
0037_00.00.44.435-00.00.46.245	who is married and has two children.

0037_00.01.00.540-00.01.04.850	to save Ben, Amanda's boyfriend, and Eric, the Kirby's son.
0037_00.01.04.850-00.01.09.580	Grant attempts to protest, but the Kirby's hired mercenaries knock him out.
0037_00.01.09.595-00.01.12.195	After a rough landing

0037_00.01.15.525-00.01.18.310	the remaining survivors escape to search for Ben and Eric.
0037_00.01.18.310-00.01.20.780	They find the parasail in a tree, 
0037_00.01.20.780-00.01.23.040	where they also find some Raptor eggs, causing them to flee.
0037_00.01.23.040-00.01.27.080	They run and hide in an abandoned InGen compound, 
0037_00.01.27.080-00.01.30.020	where they are pursued by Raptors and other dinosaurs,
0037_00.01.30.020-00.01.31.750	and a few of the members of the group are picked off.

0037_00.01.36.990-00.01.41.220	however, Amanda's boyfriend, Ben, was not so lucky.
0037_00.01.41.230-00.01.45.090	Grant starts to believe that the Raptors are actually searching for something
0037_00.01.45.090-00.01.51.550	and later on discovers that his assistant, Billy, actually stole some of the Raptor eggs and that's why the Raptors are so viciously pursuing them.
0037_00.01.51.550-00.01.55.120	The group mistakenly enters into the Pteranodon's house, which attack the group
0037_00.01.55.120-00.01.58.600	 and Eric is picked up and carried away.
0037_00.01.58.600-00.02.00.750	Billy saves Eric by using the parasail,

0037_00.02.12.510-00.02.18.600	They find a ringing phone that they had lost much earlier in the movie, after the Spinosaurus ate it, and pick it up

0037_00.02.20.910-00.02.26.340	However, the Spinosaurus comes back, attacks the boat, 
0037_00.02.26.340-00.02.28.590	which is eventually scared off after the boat's fuel is set on fire.
0037_00.02.28.590-00.02.33.235	Eventually they all make it to shore, only to be surrounded by Raptors still wanting their eggs back.

0037_00.02.36.205-00.02.42.220	while using a Raptor larynx that he had 3D printed to try to sort of communicate with the pack.

0039_00.00.54.515-00.00.56.840	and come back to the Valley of Peace to take revenge for being denied the dragon scroll.
0039_00.00.56.840-00.01.02.480	The dragon scroll has been told to have the secret of limitless power.
0039_00.01.02.480-00.01.04.690	Shifu, concerned about Tai Lung's possible escape,
0039_00.01.04.690-00.01.08.390	 sends a goose messenger to warn the guards,
0039_00.01.08.390-00.01.11.290	however, one of the feathers from the goose falls
0039_00.01.11.290-00.01.13.070	 and Tai Lung is able to escape from prison.
0039_00.01.13.070-00.01.20.780	While all this is going on, Shifu holds a Kung Fu tournament in the hopes of identifying the mystical dragon warrior,
0039_00.01.20.780-00.01.24.700	the one who's supposed to be worthy of the dragon scroll and capable of defeating Tai Lung.
0039_00.01.24.705-00.01.27.845	Po arrives at the tournament to sell noodles,
0039_00.01.27.845-00.01.31.180	but is unable to actually see what's going on in the tournament.
0039_00.01.31.180-00.01.34.780	Desperate to see what is going on, he strapped some fireworks to himself 
0039_00.01.34.780-00.01.39.780	and lands right in the middle of the arena, right as Oogway is selecting the Dragon Warrior.
0039_00.01.39.790-00.01.42.500	To everyone's surprise, Po is proclaimed the Dragon Warrior.
0039_00.01.42.500-00.01.47.130	Shifu believes that Oogway is mistaken in thinking Po is the Dragon Warrior
0039_00.01.47.130-00.01.50.630	 and tries to get Po to quit, which can be seen though his training montage.
0039_00.01.50.630-00.01.54.910	The Furious Five are also not happy about the selection,
0039_00.01.54.910-00.01.57.580	especially Tigress, who thought she should be the Dragon Warrior herself.
0039_00.01.57.585-00.02.01.735	Oogway convinces Shifu to promise to train Po
0039_00.02.01.735-00.02.06.015	and Oogway turns into a cloud of peach blossoms, presumably dying.
0039_00.02.06.015-00.02.10.425	Shifu realizes that Po can perform some amazing feats, 
0039_00.02.10.425-00.02.15.700	so long as he is motivated by food and he uses this knowledge in order to train Po.
0039_00.02.15.700-00.02.22.840	While Po is completing his training, the Furious Five set out to take on Tai Lung, believing Po will be unable to defeat him. 
0039_00.02.22.840-00.02.26.130	Tai Lung is quickly able to defeat the Furious Five
0039_00.02.26.130-00.02.26.610	UNMATCHED: and continues to the valley.
0039_00.02.26.610-00.02.28.600	Shifu gives Po the dragon scroll,
0039_00.02.28.600-00.02.32.070	but it is revealed that there is actually nothing on the scroll.
0039_00.02.32.070-00.02.35.980	Shifu, believing the scroll is useless,
0039_00.02.35.980-00.02.38.140	has the Furious Five and Po evacuate the valley as Tai Lung arrives.
0039_00.02.38.140-00.02.50.750	Po finds his father, who decides to console Po by telling him the secret ingredient to his secret ingredient soup that is super famous, telling him that nothing is actually the secret ingredient.
0039_00.02.50.750-00.02.55.770	Po's father explains that the soup is special because people believe it is.
0039_00.02.55.770-00.03.03.220	Po realizes that this is the same concept that applies to the Dragon scroll and that the limitless power comes from within the Dragon Warrior.
0039_00.03.03.225-00.03.06.085	Po returns back to the temple to fight Tai Lung
0039_00.03.06.085-00.03.08.585	before Tai Lung can kill Shifu.

0039_00.03.13.255-00.03.14.660	while Tai Lunch tries to read the Dragon scroll.

0039_00.03.24.095-00.03.28.595	who attempts to attain inner peace, now that the valley is safe.
0040_00.00.30.320-00.00.36.490	The film opens with a scene taking place many years before the first film with Lord Shen,
0040_00.00.36.490-00.00.39.090	the ruler of Gongmen City in Ancient China, 
0040_00.00.39.090-00.00.42.470	 trying to harness fireworks as a weapon.

0040_00.00.44.670-00.00.50.000	 that a warrior of black and white will one day defeat him if he does not change his ways.
0040_00.00.50.000-00.00.56.160	In response, Lord Shen leads an army of wolves to exterminate all the pandas in the land out of fear that a panda is the foretold warrior.
0040_00.00.56.160-00.00.59.510	Back in present day, we find Po and the Furious Five are protecting the valley
0040_00.00.59.510-00.01.02.850	under the guidance of Master Shifu.
0040_00.01.02.850-00.01.06.130	While defending a village from wolves working for Shen,

0040_00.01.09.850-00.01.11.300	causing Po to have a flashback of his mother.

0040_00.01.17.860-00.01.21.405	and Ping tells Po that he was found in a radish crate.

0040_00.01.23.205-00.01.27.875	however, Shifu receives word that Lord Shen has killed a kung fu master 
0040_00.01.27.875-00.01.30.695	and is plotting to conquer China using a cannon that fires weaponized fireworks.
0040_00.01.30.700-00.01.36.510	Po and the Furious Five set out to Gongman City to stop Shen and destroy the weapon.
0040_00.01.36.510-00.01.39.190	When they arrive, however, they are captured by Shen's wolves
0040_00.01.39.190-00.01.41.230	and are brought before Shen.
0040_00.01.41.235-00.01.44.135	The heroes, however, are able to free themselves
0040_00.01.44.135-00.01.45.875	and destroy Shen's weapon.

0040_00.01.48.965-00.01.51.175	which allows Shen to escape.

0040_00.01.57.380-00.02.00.480	which he explains he remembers Shen being there when he was separated from his family and that Po now wants answers from Shen about his past.

0040_00.02.04.645-00.02.09.965	but Po ignores her and breaks into the factory, foiling the Furious Five's plan to destroy the factory to capture Shen.

0041_00.02.14.365-00.02.17.415	but they are held off by the pandas.
0041_00.02.17.420-00.02.20.445	Eventually, Po and Kai engaged in a fight.
0041_00.02.20.445-00.02.22.705	Both get transported to the beyond
0041_00.02.22.705-00.02.25.205	where Kai gains the advantage and begins petrifying Po.

0041_00.02.28.495-00.02.31.280	his friends and family use their chi to save him.

0041_00.02.33.870-00.02.36.450	who explodes, killing him, 
0041_00.02.36.450-00.02.41.330	and restoring all the falling masters to normal, as well as transporting them back to the mortal world. 
0041_00.02.41.330-00.02.50.150	Grand Master Oogway appears to Po and reveals that Po was selected as Dragon Warrior because of his ancestry from the ancient pandas.
0041_00.02.50.150-00.02.52.490	He declares Po as his true successor.
0041_00.02.52.490-00.02.56.330	Po wields a mystic green staff to return to the mortal world
0041_00.02.56.330-00.02.58.790	and returns with his friends and family to the valley, 
0041_00.02.58.790-00.03.02.660	where they continue practicing kung fu and their chi.
0042_00.00.28.865-00.00.32.205	The film takes place several years after a nuclear holocaust 
0042_00.00.32.205-00.00.37.165	where we find the world has become a desert wasteland and civilization has collapse.
0042_00.00.37.165-00.00.39.785	We see a survivor named Max Rockatansky, the name sake of the film, 
0042_00.00.39.785-00.00.43.405	who is captured by the War Boys.
0042_00.00.43.405-00.00.46.695	The War Boys are the army of Immorten Joe
0042_00.00.46.695-00.00.49.080	and Max is brought to Joe's Citadel.
0042_00.00.49.080-00.00.51.370	Max is marked as a universal blood donor
0042_00.00.51.370-00.00.56.230	and is given to a sick War Boy named Nux, in order to be used as a blood bag.
0042_00.00.56.230-00.01.01.940	Meanwhile, one of Joe's lieutenants, Imperator Furiosa,
0042_00.01.01.940-00.01.06.480	 is sent to drive an armored semi-truck called the War Rig, to collect gasoline.
0042_00.01.06.480-00.01.10.330	However, she ends up leading the convoy off the path
0042_00.01.10.330-00.01.16.450	and it is revealed that Joe's five wives, beautiful women who were selected for breeding, have escaped with Furiosa, 
0042_00.01.16.450-00.01.24.860	so Joe sends an army after Furiosa, calling for aid from two other organizations, one from Gas Town and the other from the Bullet Farm.
0042_00.01.24.870-00.01.30.655	The War Boy, Nux, also joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car to continue his blood supply.
0042_00.01.30.655-00.01.34.825	Joe's forces continue pursue Furiosa's War Rig, 
0042_00.01.34.825-00.01.39.115	 and she drives into a sandstorm,
0042_00.01.39.115-00.01.41.220	where she loses most of Joe's forces, except for Nux.
0042_00.01.41.220-00.01.45.330	Nux tries to sacrifice himself to destroy the rig, 
0042_00.01.45.330-00.01.48.040	but fails and the car, which used to be owned by Max, is destroyed.
0042_00.01.48.045-00.01.49.705	Max survives the crash
0042_00.01.49.705-00.01.51.905	and approaches Furiosa and the wives,

0042_00.01.55.020-00.01.57.040	who is pregnant with Joe's child.

0042_00.01.58.015-00.02.01.985	 but Furiosa installed a kill switch that only she knows how to activate.

0042_00.02.05.040-00.02.07.570	while Nux is left to be picked up by Joe's army.

0042_00.02.25.220-00.02.29.870	Furiosa explains to Max that they are headed to the promised land, called the Green Place, that Furiosa remembers from her childhood.
0042_00.02.29.870-00.02.34.870	One of the wives finds Nux injured aboard the War Rig, and tries to console him.
0042_00.02.34.870-00.02.37.370	Furiosa and Max continue to fight off Joe's forces
0042_00.02.37.370-00.02.40.660	 as they travel through swampland
0042_00.02.40.660-00.02.44.035	 and desert, and eventually meet up with a group of female motorcyclists, known as the Vuvalini.
0042_00.02.44.035-00.02.49.565	The Vuvalini reveal that they are actually the former members of the Green Place,
0042_00.02.49.565-00.02.53.050	which has now reverted to the inhospitable swamp that Max and Furiosa had just drove through.
0042_00.02.53.050-00.02.58.490	The group realizes that they have very few options
0042_00.02.58.490-00.03.00.200	and decide to travel back to Joe's Citadel, as it is not defended at the moment, 
0042_00.03.00.200-00.03.02.580	and Joe has a very large supply of water.
0042_00.03.02.580-00.03.06.365	They travel back and encounter Joe's forces once again.
0042_00.03.06.365-00.03.07.955	Furiosa is stabbed, 
0042_00.03.07.955-00.03.12.490	but Furiosa is able to kill Joe by tearing off his breathing mask.

0042_00.03.15.280-00.03.19.235	destroying the canyon and blocking Joe's remaining forces from pursuing.

0042_00.03.25.445-00.03.29.080	and Max gives Furiosa his blood so she can survive her stab wound.
0042_00.03.29.080-00.03.32.240	At the Citadel, the citizens rejoice at the sight of Joe's corpse.
0042_00.03.32.240-00.03.36.080	The group is cheered and welcomed by the remaining War Boys
0042_00.03.36.080-00.03.38.530	and Max walks off into the distance.
0043_00.00.31.425-00.00.35.975	The film opens with IMF agent, Trevor Hannah,
0043_00.00.35.975-00.00.38.325	who attempted to intercept a courier working for someone known as Cobalt.
0043_00.00.38.330-00.00.44.820	Trevor, however, is killed by the assissin Sabine Moreau and the briefcase he has is stolen.
0043_00.00.44.820-00.00.46.840	The film then switches to Ethan Hunt,
0043_00.00.46.840-00.00.48.690	who is being broken out of a Moscow jail
0043_00.00.48.690-00.00.50.800	 by Benji Dunn and Jane Carter.
0043_00.00.50.800-00.00.54.815	While escaping, Ethan also frees a Russian source known as Bogdan.
0043_00.00.54.815-00.00.58.355	The IMF team goes to the Kremlin
0043_00.00.58.355-00.01.02.360	 in order to find files about the true identity of Cobalt.
0043_00.01.02.360-00.01.05.990	However, during this mission they're compromised by someone
0043_00.01.05.990-00.01.11.330	and then that same person bombs the Kremlin and Ethan is injured.
0043_00.01.11.340-00.01.20.140	Ethan wakes up in a hospital to a Russian agent, Anatoly Sidorov, arresting Ethan, believing that he is the cause of the Kremlin bombing.
0043_00.01.20.140-00.01.24.110	Ethan escapes and has the IMF secretary extract him.
0043_00.01.24.120-00.01.37.230	The secretary tells him that the Russians believe that the Kremlin bombing was an act of war from the US and the president has issued a Ghost Protocol, disavowing the IMF and Ethan and his team are taking the blame.
0043_00.01.37.230-00.01.41.630	The secretary knows it's not his fault and tells him that there's a nearby cache of IMF supplies.
0043_00.01.41.630-00.01.45.400	Their car is attacked by Russian forces and Ethan escapes.
0043_00.01.45.405-00.01.50.095	His team is already at the cache
0043_00.01.50.095-00.01.53.065	and he is joined by intelligence analyst, William Brandt.
0043_00.01.53.065-00.01.54.815	With IMF being disavowed, 
0043_00.01.54.815-00.01.56.980	Brandt's knowledge and ability to identify important figures is key.
0043_00.01.56.980-00.02.03.640	Brandt identifies Cobalt as Kurt Hendricks, a Russian nuclear strategist, whose goal is to start a nuclear war.
0043_00.02.03.645-00.02.05.955	Hendricks bombed the Kremlin 
0043_00.02.05.955-00.02.07.620	in order to distract from the fact that he was stealing a Russian nuclear launch control device.
0043_00.02.07.620-00.02.10.630	However, he still needs the activation codes
0043_00.02.10.630-00.02.15.130	which he was supposed to get from the courier at the beginning of the film.
0043_00.02.15.135-00.02.18.095	The team travels to Dubai 
0043_00.02.18.095-00.02.19.935	 in order to intercept an exchange between Moreau
0043_00.02.19.935-00.02.22.385	and Hendrick's right-hand man, Wistrom.
0043_00.02.22.390-00.02.25.830	Moreau and Wistrom have never met, so they trick them into different rooms.
0043_00.02.25.835-00.02.28.565	Moreau meets with Ethan and Brandt
0043_00.02.28.565-00.02.30.610	while Wistrom meets with Jane.
0043_00.02.30.610-00.02.35.570	Wistrom also brought an expert with him in order to verify that he's receiving the real launch codes.
0043_00.02.35.575-00.02.39.655	Through some sleight of hand and fancy gadgets, they're able to trick both parties
0043_00.02.39.655-00.02.43.730	and they attempt to follow Wistrom in order to locate Hendricks.
0043_00.02.43.730-00.02.45.710	A fight breaks out between both groups.
0043_00.02.45.715-00.02.46.785	Moreau is killed
0043_00.02.46.785-00.02.54.270	and Wistrom escapes, however, while Wistrom is escaping, it is revealed that Wistrom is really Hendricks in disguise.
0043_00.02.54.270-00.02.57.210	Afterwards, Ethan leaves to go meet with an informant.
0043_00.02.57.220-00.03.06.540	While Ethan is gone, it is revealed by Brandt that Ethan's wife, Julia, who we thought from the beginning of the film was just divorced or separated from Ethan, was actually killed.
0043_00.03.06.540-00.03.14.390	Ethan meets with Bogdan, the man Ethan saved from the Moscow prison and Bogdan's cousin, an arms dealer, 
0043_00.03.14.390-00.03.19.320	who explained that Hendricks still needs to access a military satellite in order to trigger the missiles and that the most likely target will be an Indian telecommunications company.
0043_00.03.19.320-00.03.22.600	The team travels to Mumbai
0043_00.03.22.600-00.03.23.160	UNMATCHED: in order to disable the satellite before Hendricks can fire the missile.

0043_00.03.27.382-00.03.32.272	Hendricks, however, is successful at firing the missile before they can disable the satellite 
0043_00.03.32.272-00.03.37.082	so Ethan decides he must abort the nuclear warhead directly from the panel Hendricks used to fire the missile.
0043_00.03.37.085-00.03.41.535	They break into a fight, Hendricks dies
0043_00.03.41.535-00.03.42.975	and at the last second, Ethan disables the missile 
0043_00.03.42.975-00.03.48.140	before it strikes the city of San Fransisco.
0043_00.03.48.140-00.03.55.500	Sidorov enters right as the missile is aborted, realizes Ethan is really on their side and that he is innocent of the Kremlin bombing.
0043_00.03.55.500-00.03.59.610	The team meets up a few weeks later with Luther and accepts a new mission.
0043_00.03.59.610-00.04.02.640	Ethan reveals to Brandt that Julia is actually alive 
0043_00.04.02.640-00.04.07.940	and the film ends with Julia and Ethan smiling at each other from a distance.
0044_00.00.17.985-00.00.21.985	The film starts out following Jim Phelps, 
0044_00.00.21.985-00.00.24.520	the head of a team known as the Impossible Mission Force, or IMF.
0044_00.00.24.520-00.00.26.370	The team is being used to intercept a man in Prague
0044_00.00.26.370-00.00.31.290	who is trying to steal the IMF non-official cover list, also known as the NOC list, which links code names of agents to their real names.

0044_00.00.34.570-00.00.37.275	This would be highly valuable to those who want to get rid of these agents.
0044_00.00.37.275-00.00.40.865	However, the mission goes wrong, and nearly the entire team is killed, 
0044_00.00.40.865-00.00.43.295	including the team lead, Jim Phelps
0044_00.00.43.295-00.00.46.710	and his wife, Claire.
0044_00.00.46.710-00.00.47.440	All except Ethan Hunt, who does survive.
0044_00.00.47.440-00.00.49.810	Ethan sets up a meeting with the IMF director, Eugene Kittredge.
0044_00.00.49.820-00.01.00.420	Ethan finds out that the whole job was a ruse to try to lure out a mole in the IMF, who has been communicating with an arms dealer named Max, 
0044_00.01.00.420-00.01.03.980	as part of something known as Job 314.
0044_00.01.03.985-00.01.09.595	Kittredge suspects that Ethan is the mole as he is the sole survivor of the mission
0044_00.01.09.595-00.01.12.120	and Ethan realizes he is surrounded by IMF agents.
0044_00.01.12.125-00.01.14.395	Ethan escapes
0044_00.01.14.395-00.01.17.365	and returns back to his safe house.
0044_00.01.17.370-00.01.24.820	There, he discovers that Job 314 is not actually a job, but is referring to the Book of Job from the Bible, which are spelled the same.
0044_00.01.24.820-00.01.27.770	While at the safe house, Claire, Jim Phelps' wife, returns,
0044_00.01.27.770-00.01.33.120	explaining that she ran from the car she was in before it exploded once the mission was aborted.
0044_00.01.33.120-00.01.35.420	Ethan sets up a meeting with the arms dealer, Max,
0044_00.01.35.420-00.01.40.700	who turns out to be an older British woman, 
0044_00.01.40.700-00.01.45.950	and Ethan tells her that he will give her the real NOC list in exchange for 10 million dollars and the indentity of Job, who is the mole in IMF.
0044_00.01.45.955-00.01.53.955	Ethan recruits Luther Stickell, a computer expert, as well as Franz Krieger, a pilot,
0044_00.01.53.955-00.01.57.230	in order to break into the CIA headquarters to steal the real NOC list.
0044_00.01.57.230-00.01.59.710	There's a great deal of security, and they must come in from the ceiling,
0044_00.01.59.710-00.02.03.180	but eventually, they are able to get the list.
0044_00.02.03.185-00.02.07.485	Kittredge finds out that the list has been taken
0044_00.02.07.485-00.02.10.950	and has Ethan's parents arrested on trumped up charges to get Ethan to call him.
0044_00.02.10.950-00.02.14.650	Ethan intentionally lets them track him to London, to bring the IMF to him.
0044_00.02.14.660-00.02.18.830	Ethan runs into Jim Phelps, who we had previously thought was dead.
0044_00.02.18.835-00.02.22.075	Jim tells Ethan that Kittredge is behind the whole attack, which Ethan pretends to agree with,
0044_00.02.22.075-00.02.29.330	but Ethan realizes that Jim is the mole, who is the reason his team is dead, and is really Job.
0044_00.02.29.330-00.02.35.270	They part ways, but Ethan is uncertain if Jim's wife Claire was involved or not.
0044_00.02.35.270-00.02.38.950	Ethan sets up an exchange for the NOC list on a high speed train.
0044_00.02.38.950-00.02.41.920	While Max attempts to verify the list, 
0044_00.02.41.920-00.02.43.980	Ethan takes the 10 million dollars
0044_00.02.43.980-00.02.44.920	and Claire comes to meet him.
0044_00.02.44.925-00.02.47.825	However, Claire reaches the baggage car 
0044_00.02.47.825-00.02.51.185	and meets with her husband, Jim, where she talks about whether they should kill Ethan or not.
0044_00.02.51.190-00.02.55.840	However, Jim is not actually Jim, but Ethan wearing a mask
0044_00.02.55.840-00.02.57.010	in a ploy to test whether Claire is working with Jim.
0044_00.02.57.010-00.03.01.460	The real Jim appears and takes the 10 million dollars from Ethan.
0044_00.03.01.460-00.03.02.130	UNMATCHED: and takes the 10 million dollars from Ethan.

0044_00.03.03.730-00.03.08.720	to relay to the IMFagent aboard the train that Jim is still alive.
0044_00.03.08.720-00.03.08.980	Jim tries to shoot Ethan,
0044_00.03.08.980-00.03.12.410	but Claire ends up taking the bullet.
0044_00.03.12.410-00.03.14.310	Jim climbs to the roof of the train,
0044_00.03.14.310-00.03.19.520	where Krieger, the pilot that Ethan used earlier in the film, is waiting to airlift him off the train.
0044_00.03.19.520-00.03.21.660	They enter into a tunnel,
0044_00.03.21.660-00.03.26.890	and using some explosive gum from earlier in the movie, blows up the helicopter, killing Jim and Krieger.
0044_00.03.26.890-00.03.31.370	Kittredge arrests Max on the train and the NOC list is returned.
0044_00.03.31.370-00.03.36.080	Ethan and Stickell are exonerated, but Ethan resigns from the IMF.
0044_00.03.36.080-00.03.43.980	However, aboard a flight home, a flight attendant uses a coded phrase and offers him a new mission, indicating he probably does take it.
0045_00.00.26.825-00.00.32.415	The film opens with a Russian biochemist, Dr. Vladimir, of Biocyte Pharmaceuticals,
0045_00.00.32.415-00.00.36.540	injecting himself with a new bio-weapon, known as Chimera.
0045_00.00.36.540-00.00.40.450	Chimera is a highly deadly virus that Dr. Vladimir was forced to make by his company.
0045_00.00.40.455-00.00.44.825	Dr. Vladimir plans to take the cure, known as Bellerophon,
0045_00.00.44.825-00.00.46.605	 to the United States aboard a plane, 
0045_00.00.46.605-00.00.48.915	where he is met by a man who is disguised as Ethan Hunt.
0045_00.00.48.915-00.00.50.665	Dr. Vladimir is attacked, 
0045_00.00.50.665-00.00.51.705	the cure is stolen,
0045_00.00.51.705-00.00.56.335	and the plane is crashed, killing Dr. Vladimir and the passengers aboard.
0045_00.00.56.340-00.01.01.490	Dr. Vladimir was able to contact the IMF prior to his death, 
0045_00.01.01.490-00.01.06.120	and they are worried that the former IMF agent, Sean Ambrose, is behind the attack and will release the virus.
0045_00.01.06.130-00.01.09.660	Ethan and his team,
0045_00.01.09.660-00.01.10.950	 consisting of computer expert, Lether Stickell, who is the the first film,
0045_00.01.10.950-00.01.12.700	pilot Billy Baird,
0045_00.01.12.700-00.01.15.870	and a professional thief, Nyah Nordhoff-Hall, 
0045_00.01.15.870-00.01.17.410	who is the ex-girlfriend of Sean.
0045_00.01.17.415-00.01.20.275	The team investigates Sean's headquarters
0045_00.01.20.275-00.01.23.075	and also investigates Sean at a horse race track,
0045_00.01.23.075-00.01.25.035	and are able to steal some information from him
0045_00.01.25.035-00.01.26.035	about the Chimera virus.
0045_00.01.26.035-00.01.28.325	They discover once a person is infected,
0045_00.01.28.325-00.01.30.745	they only have a 20 hour window that the cure, Bellerophon, can be used, 
0045_00.01.30.745-00.01.34.410	and after that, the infected person will die.
0045_00.01.34.410-00.01.43.690	The IMF team then kidnaps John C. McCloy, the CEO of Biocyte Pharmaceuticals, who developed the virus and the cure.
0045_00.01.43.690-00.01.46.080	They find that Sean only has the cure to the virus, but not the virus itself, 
0045_00.01.46.080-00.01.48.980	so the IMF team attempts to break into the Biocyte facilities 
0045_00.01.48.985-00.01.50.910	to destroy the remaining virus,
0045_00.01.50.910-00.01.53.090	however, Sean is there with his men.
0045_00.01.53.095-00.01.54.855	Sean also brought Nyah with him, 
0045_00.01.54.855-00.01.58.290	who he uses to retrieve the virus, knowing that Ethan will not shoot her.
0045_00.01.58.290-00.02.03.490	Nyah, however, injects herself with the last remaining strain of the virus, infecting herself.
0045_00.02.03.490-00.02.10.405	She knows that this will protect her from being killed by Sean, at least until he can find a way to properly use the virus.
0045_00.02.10.405-00.02.15.275	Sean decides to let Nyah out in the streets of Sydney in hopes of triggering a pandemic,
0045_00.02.15.275-00.02.17.655	causing massive demand for the cure, Bellerophon.
0045_00.02.17.660-00.02.29.270	Sean also forces McCloy to sell him enough shares of Biocyte to give Sean the majority control.
0045_00.02.29.270-00.02.30.080	UNMATCHED:  With the incredibly high demand for Bellerophon, Biocyte's stock price will greatly increase, making Sean an obscene amount of money.
0045_00.02.30.085-00.02.32.065	However, Ethan breaks in the meeting
0045_00.02.32.065-00.02.34.450	and steals the samples of Bellerophon.
0045_00.02.34.460-00.02.40.910	Nyah has walked to a cliffside in order to kill herself and keep herself from other people, to prevent them from getting the virus.
0045_00.02.40.910-00.02.43.230	There is a long chase,
0045_00.02.43.230-00.02.46.030	then a showdown between Sean and Ethan,
0045_00.02.46.030-00.02.47.830	but Ethan wins in the end
0045_00.02.47.830-00.02.51.280	and gets the cure to Nyah.
0045_00.02.51.280-00.02.51.685	UNMATCHED:  There is no sign left of the virus, and mission is complete
0045_00.02.51.687-00.02.52.075	UNMATCHED: The IMF clears Nyah's criminal history,  
0045_00.02.52.075-00.02.56.575	and Ethan continues his vacation with her in Sydney.
0046_00.00.33.730-00.00.38.360	The film opens with Katniss being in District 13, the headquarters of the Rebellion led by President Coin.
0046_00.00.38.380-00.00.46.880	Coin explains to Katniss that her role in the Rebellion will be to be a symbol of the uprising, and will be known as the Mockingjay.
0046_00.00.46.880-00.00.49.550	At first she does not want to be a symbol,
0046_00.00.49.550-00.00.53.530	but when she sees her home district and how it was destroyed by the Capitol, she decides to become a symbol.
0046_00.00.53.530-00.00.57.760	She is constantly filmed
0046_00.00.57.760-00.01.00.800	so that everything can be used as footage for propaganda
0046_00.01.00.800-00.01.04.810	and use that footage to splay over hack TV channels across all of Panem.
0046_00.01.04.810-00.01.07.820	However, in exchange for being the Rebellion's Mockingjay,
0046_00.01.07.820-00.01.12.490	she demands that the Rebels get Peeta back, who was captured by the Capitol
0046_00.01.12.500-00.01.16.320	and is being used and abused by the Capitol to make their own counter-propaganda.
0046_00.01.16.320-00.01.19.700	Katniss is fitted with a specially designed outfit,
0046_00.01.19.700-00.01.22.000	given her own camera crew,
0046_00.01.22.000-00.01.23.950	Effie Trinket as her stylist,
0046_00.01.23.950-00.01.27.070	and Gale as her bodyguard.
0046_00.01.27.070-00.01.29.010	Katniss travels to various districts,
0046_00.01.29.010-00.01.30.410	sometimes fighting,
0046_00.01.30.410-00.01.32.210	sometimes just visiting the wreckage,
0046_00.01.32.210-00.01.36.090	but all the actions are filmed and used for propaganda.
0046_00.01.36.090-00.01.38.300	In a live counter-propaganda speech from Peeta,
0046_00.01.38.300-00.01.43.450	he warns District 13 that they're about to be attacked, which obviously he wasn't supposed to say,
0046_00.01.43.450-00.01.46.720	and is beaten and maybe possibly killed.
0046_00.01.46.720-00.01.49.850	District 13 has enough time to prepare for the attack,
0046_00.01.49.850-00.01.53.230	and after the attack is over they send out a team to rescue Peeta.
0046_00.01.53.230-00.01.56.270	Peeta is rescued.
0046_00.01.56.270-00.01.57.650	However, when Katniss goes to meet him,
0046_00.01.57.650-00.02.02.700	Peeta tries to kill Katniss and it is found that he is been "hijacked" or brainwashed using venom from tracker checkers.
0046_00.02.02.700-00.02.07.120	So Peeta is kept in isolation,
0046_00.02.07.120-00.02.11.630	and the Rebellion plans to move forward with their war, and thus concluding the film.
0047_00.00.30.020-00.00.35.860	The film opens with an organization, known as the Federation, imposing a blockade
0047_00.00.35.860-00.00.38.630	on a planet known as Naboo due to taxation on trade routes.
0047_00.00.38.630-00.00.43.200	The Galactic Republic, the government of most of the central planets in the galaxy,
0047_00.00.43.200-00.00.50.340	 dispatches two Jedi Knights, Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to investigate the matter.
0047_00.00.50.350-00.00.57.350	The short explanation of who the Jedis are is they are warriors that use weapons called lightsabers
0047_00.00.57.350-00.01.00.890	and have special powers which they harness through something called The Force.
0047_00.01.00.890-00.01.05.390	The Jedis are viewed as the good guys throughout the films.
0047_00.01.05.390-00.01.10.730	The Trade Federation is working under the direction of Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord.
0047_00.01.10.730-00.01.17.130	The Siths are kind of the evil opposite of the Jedi, more of the dark side of The Force.
0047_00.01.17.130-00.01.19.710	The Jedi arrive
0047_00.01.19.710-00.01.22.060	 to negotiate with Viceroy Gunray, the leader of the Federation.
0047_00.01.22.065-00.01.26.345	However, the Viceroy is ordered to kill the Jedi 
0047_00.01.26.345-00.01.29.345	and invade the planet of Naboo with a droid army.
0047_00.01.29.345-00.01.32.525	The Jedi escape, hiding aboard one of the droid landing ships
0047_00.01.32.525-00.01.35.425	and arrive on the planet Naboo.
0047_00.01.35.425-00.01.38.465	The Jedi meet the Gungan Jar Jar Binks,
0047_00.01.38.465-00.01.41.520	who takes them to the secret underwater Gungan City.
0047_00.01.41.520-00.01.46.220	The leader of the Gungans is unwilling to help the surface civilization of Naboo from the droid invasion,
0047_00.01.46.220-00.01.51.035	but does give the Jedi transport to the Naboo capital city.
0047_00.01.51.035-00.01.56.075	The Jedi then rescue Queen Amidala, the Democratic leader of the Naboo people, 
0047_00.01.56.075-00.01.57.375	and escape Naboo,
0047_00.01.57.375-00.02.00.310	though their ship is severely damaged.
0047_00.02.00.310-00.02.04.820	The damaged ship lands on the desert planet of Tatooine in order to repair its hyperdrive.
0047_00.02.04.825-00.02.08.475	Qui-Gon, Jar Jar,
0047_00.02.08.475-00.02.10.755	a droid named R2D2,

0047_00.02.12.965-00.02.18.505	all go to the city of Mos Espa to find the parts that are needed.

0047_00.02.22.335-00.02.25.805	and his slave, a nine year old boy named Anakin Skywalker.
0047_00.02.25.810-00.02.27.280	Anakin is a skilled engineer,
0047_00.02.27.280-00.02.30.910	having built a robot assisted droid named C-3PO.
0047_00.02.30.910-00.02.36.520	Anakin is also a talented pod racer, a type of dangerous high-speed racing.
0047_00.02.36.520-00.02.47.060	Qui-Gon can tell that Anakin has an extremely strong tie to The Force and appears to be the chosen one that the Jedi prophecy foretells of, the one that should bring balance to The Force.
0047_00.02.47.060-00.02.50.290	Qui-Gon tries to use his money that they have in order to buy their parts, 
0047_00.02.50.290-00.02.54.030	but Watto is not interested in their foreign currency.
0047_00.02.54.035-00.02.56.770	Through a series of events, Qui-Gon makes a bet with Watto,
0047_00.02.56.770-00.03.02.340	that if Anakin wins the next big pod race, that they will get all the parts that they need and Anakin will also be freed.
0047_00.03.02.345-00.03.06.015	Qui-Gon also tries to barter for Anakin's mother, 
0047_00.03.06.015-00.03.09.625	Shmi, but is unsuccessful.
0047_00.03.09.625-00.03.12.145	Anakin wins the race
0047_00.03.12.145-00.03.12.405	UNMATCHED:  and they get the hyperdrive they need.
0047_00.03.12.410-00.03.19.290	Anakin vows to become a Jedi one day and will find a way to free his mother.
0047_00.03.19.290-00.03.23.900	With their ship repaired, they travel to the galactic capital of Coruscant 
0047_00.03.23.900-00.03.29.540	so Queen Amidala can plead for aid for Naboo before the Galactic Senate.
0047_00.03.29.540-00.03.32.140	Under the recommendation of Naboo Senator, Palpatine,
0047_00.03.32.140-00.03.35.440	Queen Amidala issues a vote of no confidence
0047_00.03.35.440-00.03.38.410	 for the current Chancellor, the leader of the Galactic Republic.
0047_00.03.38.410-00.03.46.310	While she is doing this, Qui-Gon takes Anakin before the Jedi Council to request that he be trained as a Jedi.
0047_00.03.46.310-00.03.51.470	The Council feels that he is too concerned with his emotions and he has potential to be swayed to the dark side of The Force.
0047_00.03.51.470-00.03.54.330	Qui-Gon vows however, to train Anakin himself.
0047_00.03.54.335-00.03.57.965	Queen Amidala is frustrated with the corruption in the Senate and cannot wait for the vote of no confidence to go through,
0047_00.03.57.965-00.04.04.335	so she returns back to the planet of Naboo with a Jedi.
0047_00.04.04.340-00.04.10.980	The hand maiden, Padme, reveals that she is actually Queen Amidala,
0047_00.04.10.980-00.04.13.600	and the actual Queen has actually been involved in the film much more than the audience had initially thought.
0047_00.04.13.610-00.04.17.070	They enlist the aid of the Gungans,

0053_00.03.30.810-00.03.34.610	Superman eventually does kill Zod by snapping his neck.
0053_00.03.34.615-00.03.38.495	As the film concludes, the US government decides to help Superman conceal his identity,
0053_00.03.38.495-00.03.43.875	where he goes by the name Clark and works for the Daily Planet.
0054_00.00.29.130-00.00.33.030	The film opens in the year 1995 where John Connor is now 10 years old, 
0054_00.00.33.030-00.00.35.330	living with his foster parents.
0054_00.00.35.335-00.00.42.625	His Mom, Sarah Connor, was arrested for attempting to bomb a computer factory, presumably one related to Skynet,
0054_00.00.42.625-00.00.44.415	and is placed in a mental hospital.
0054_00.00.44.415-00.00.46.465	The robots in the future
0054_00.00.46.465-00.00.50.685	have sent a new Terminator, known as the T1000 back to kill John.
0054_00.00.50.685-00.00.53.145	T1000 is made of an amorphous metal-like substance, 
0054_00.00.53.145-00.00.57.350	allowing to change his shape and appearance.
0054_00.00.57.350-00.01.01.175	Primarily, however, he looks like a policeman that he killed in the beginning of the film.
0054_00.01.01.175-00.01.08.835	In order to defend his younger self, the future John Connor has sent back a reprogrammed T800 Terminator, 
0054_00.01.08.835-00.01.13.400	who looks very much like the Terminator who tried to kill his mother in the first film, still played by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
0054_00.01.13.400-00.01.17.610	Both the T1000 and the Terminator find John at a shopping mall.

0054_00.01.26.180-00.01.29.540	though initially, she is terrified, as she thinks the Terminator is there to try to kill her.
0054_00.01.29.540-00.01.32.570	The three of them are chased by the T1000, 
0054_00.01.32.570-00.01.33.890	but they escape.
0054_00.01.33.890-00.01.36.890	UNMATCHED
0054_00.01.36.895-00.01.40.525	The Terminator informs John and Sarah that when the new program Skynet, an artificial intelligence, goes live, 
0054_00.01.40.525-00.01.45.025	 it will initiate a nuclear holocaust, known as Judgment Day,
0054_00.01.45.025-00.01.48.465	and then it will continue to create machines to exterminate the remainder of humanity.
0054_00.01.48.465-00.01.54.235	Sarah finds out the primary man behind Skynet is Miles Bennet Dyson, 
0054_00.01.54.235-00.01.57.060	who works for Cyberdyne Systems.
0054_00.01.57.060-00.01.59.870	Miles is creating a new neural net CPU, which is the basis of Skynet.
0054_00.01.59.870-00.02.03.650	Sarah decides to try to kill Miles in order to prevent Judgment Day from occurring.
0054_00.02.03.655-00.02.08.855	When Sarah corners Miles in his home, she wounds him,
0054_00.02.08.855-00.02.09.795	but is unable to execute him in front of his family.
0054_00.02.09.795-00.02.14.055	They instead warn him of the consequences that his work will bring about
0054_00.02.14.055-00.02.16.495	and Miles reveals that most of his research came from reverse engineering technology
0054_00.02.16.495-00.02.22.670	from the arm of the destroyed Terminator robot from the first film.
0054_00.02.22.670-00.02.25.110	The group then breaks into the Cyberdyne building
0054_00.02.25.110-00.02.28.000	 in order to destroy the Terminator arm and CPU stored there.
0054_00.02.28.000-00.02.33.180	The group obtains the CPU and the arm, then the police arrive 
0054_00.02.33.180-00.02.39.110	and Miles is shot, but he is able to destroy the lab and his research and sacrifices himself.
0054_00.02.39.110-00.02.44.790	The T1000 continues to chase the group into a steel mill
0054_00.02.44.790-00.02.47.680	and the Terminator tries to hold the T1000 off,
0054_00.02.47.680-00.02.51.760	and eventually the T1000 is destroyed by a grenade launcher and a vat of lava.
0054_00.02.51.760-00.02.53.960	John throws the arm and the CPU into the vat, as well.
0054_00.02.53.970-00.02.57.240	The Terminator then decides to self-terminate so he can never be reverse engineered like the arm was.
0054_00.02.57.240-00.03.03.040	He lowers himself into the vat
0054_00.03.03.040-00.03.04.670	and the film ends with Sarah thinking about the future.
0055_00.00.29.190-00.00.34.860	The film opens with John Connor living off the grid in Los Angeles after the death of this mother, Sarah, from leukemia.
0055_00.00.34.860-00.00.38.750	Even though Judgment Day, the mass destruction of human lives by the machines was avoided, 
0055_00.00.38.750-00.00.44.060	John still believes that the war will happen between the humans and the machines.
0055_00.00.44.060-00.00.51.080	The future Skynet, which apparently still exists, unable to locate where John is hiding in the past, sends back a new Terminator called the TX,
0055_00.00.51.080-00.00.57.450	to the year 2004 in order to kill other members of the human resistance.
0055_00.00.57.450-00.01.01.750	The TX has similar liquid metal properties of the T1000 from the second film.
0055_00.01.01.750-00.01.05.770	It also has advanced built-in weaponry, 
0055_00.01.05.770-00.01.07.280	as well as the ability to reprogram other machines.
0055_00.01.07.285-00.01.10.565	In response, the future human resistance sends back a reprogrammed Terminator
0055_00.01.10.565-00.01.13.715	to protect John Connor
0055_00.01.13.715-00.01.16.440	and his future wife, Kate Brewster.
0055_00.01.16.440-00.01.20.240	However, at the beginning of the film, Kate and John do not know each other.
0055_00.01.20.240-00.01.25.530	The Terminator looks just like the Terminators from the previous films, again played by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
0055_00.01.25.535-00.01.30.015	After killing several targets, the TX locates Kate and John,
0055_00.01.30.015-00.01.32.610	but they escape with the Terminator's help.
0055_00.01.32.610-00.01.37.460	The Terminator takes Kate and John to a mausoleum where John's mother, Sarah Connor, is buried, 
0055_00.01.37.460-00.01.40.440	however, in her vault, they find a massive weapons cache.
0055_00.01.40.445-00.01.43.795	A shootout takes place with the police
0055_00.01.43.795-00.01.48.850	and they all escape in a hearse.
0055_00.01.48.850-00.01.53.870	The Terminator plans on taking John and Kate to Mexico in order to escape the fallout of the new Judgment Day, which is actually supposed to happen that same day.
0055_00.01.53.880-00.01.57.830	It appears as though that Judgment Day is inevitable and all that happened in the second film was they merely pushed the Judgment Day back further.

0055_00.02.01.755-00.02.05.545	John orders the Terminator to take them to see Kate's father,

0055_00.02.18.970-00.02.27.510	It is revealed that John is killed on July 4th, 2032, by the same Terminator robot, and that the future Kate is actually who reprogrammed the Terminator and sent him back in time.
0055_00.02.27.510-00.02.34.410	Kate's father is pressured by the President to activate Skynet in order to stop a computer virus that is spreading all throughout the world.
0055_00.02.34.410-00.02.38.390	Little do they realize, the virus is actually Skynet itself.
0055_00.02.38.390-00.02.40.490	John and Kate are too late to stop Skynet's activation, 
0055_00.02.40.490-00.02.42.140	and the machines begin to kill staff members
0055_00.02.42.140-00.02.46.740	and the TX also arrives and begins fighting.

0055_00.03.10.335-00.03.14.275	The Terminator is able to crush the TX 
0055_00.03.14.275-00.03.15.860	as John and Kate run into the bunker.
0055_00.03.15.860-00.03.19.020	The Terminator holds the blast doors open long enough for John and Kate to lock themselves in.
0055_00.03.19.020-00.03.23.460	Then the Terminator uses the fuel cells to destroy the TX and himself.
0055_00.03.23.460-00.03.30.310	Kate and John discover, however, that Crystal Peak is not a site for Skynet's core, but instead is a nuclear fallout shelter.

0055_00.03.40.190-00.03.44.150	The film ends with Kate and John answering radio calls on the emergency equipment, 
0055_00.03.44.150-00.03.47.720	knowing that the war with the machines has truly begun.
0056_00.00.30.180-00.00.36.000	The film begins in 2003 with Dr. Kogan, of Cyberdyne Systems, 
0056_00.00.36.000-00.00.40.670	convincing a death row inmate, Marcus Wright, to sign over his body for medical research after his execution.

0056_00.01.15.180-00.01.19.120	where he tells General Ashdown of what he found at the base.
0056_00.01.19.120-00.01.23.440	The resistance has also learned of a kill list that the machines have to take out the command of the resistance.
0056_00.01.23.440-00.01.25.570	John is number two on the list
0056_00.01.25.570-00.01.28.470	and directly behind Kyle Reese.
0056_00.01.28.475-00.01.31.685	Most are unaware of Kyle Reese's significance, 
0056_00.01.31.685-00.01.37.235	 but John knows Kyle will eventually go back in time and actually be the father to John, which occurred in the first film.

0056_00.01.53.535-00.01.57.550	however, Marcus, Kyle, and several others are taken prisoner and placed in a transport.
0056_00.01.57.550-00.02.00.640	The transport is attacked by some resistance planes 
0056_00.02.00.640-00.02.03.000	and the prisoners are able to escape and head towards John Connor's base.

0056_00.02.14.365-00.02.18.700	and the resistance fighters discover that Marcus is actually a cyborg, however, Marcus believes that he is human.

0056_00.02.21.200-00.02.23.510	so he orders to have Marcus killed.

0056_00.02.26.065-00.02.30.910	during which Marcus saves John's life from Skynet's robots.
0056_00.02.30.910-00.02.37.140	John and Marcus make a deal, John will let Marcus live if Marcus will help break Kyle and the other prisoners free from Skynet's headquarters in San Francisco.

0056_00.02.42.390-00.02.44.130	allowing John and the resistance to enter.
0056_00.02.44.130-00.02.49.480	Marcus learns that he was actually designed by Skynet's system to lure John into the base, in order to get him killed.
0056_00.02.49.480-00.02.52.190	Skynet also uses a radio signal from the resistance
0056_00.02.52.190-00.02.53.100	to track down the human command submarine, 
0056_00.02.53.100-00.02.58.290	destroy it, killing the resistance leaders.
0056_00.02.58.295-00.03.00.645	Marcus removes the portion of hardware linking him to Skynet
0056_00.03.00.645-00.03.09.575	and helps John battle the new T800 Terminator robot, who looks very similar to a young Arnold Schwarzenegger, The Terminator from the first three films.
0056_00.03.09.575-00.03.12.185	Marcus is able to defeat the T800,
0056_00.03.12.185-00.03.14.055	though John is severely injured,
0056_00.03.14.055-00.03.17.215	but able to detonate explosives all around the Skynet base.
0056_00.03.17.215-00.03.19.765	John, Marcus and Kyle are airlifted out,
0056_00.03.19.765-00.03.22.725	and Marcus offers his own heart for transplant,
0056_00.03.22.725-00.03.25.370	in order to save the dying John.
0056_00.03.25.370-00.03.32.810	John later radios to the resistance fighters that though the battle has been won, the war is far from over, concluding the film.
0057_00.00.30.640-00.00.34.630	The film opens in the year 2029,
0057_00.00.34.630-00.00.37.660	with the human Resistance leader John Connor launching a final attack against Skynet,
0057_00.00.37.660-00.00.41.260	the AI system set out to eliminate the human race.
0057_00.00.41.260-00.00.45.570	Just before the attack, however, Skynet uses a time machine
0057_00.00.45.570-00.00.50.080	to send back a T-800 Terminator,
0057_00.00.50.080-00.00.53.070	once again looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger, in order to kill John's mother, Sarah Connor. 
0057_00.00.53.070-00.00.56.640	John, in response, sends back Kyle Reese
0057_00.00.56.640-00.00.58.180	to travel back in time in order to save her.
0057_00.00.58.180-00.01.03.720	This is very similar to the events of the first film, as the film began with the Arnold Terminator
0057_00.01.03.720-00.01.06.460	and Kyle Reese being sent back in time. 
0057_00.01.06.460-00.01.08.620	Just as Kyle's about to leave the year 2029,
0057_00.01.08.620-00.01.12.020	Kyle sees John attacked by some type of robot,
0057_00.01.12.020-00.01.14.740	and then is sent back to the year 1984, 
0057_00.01.14.740-00.01.19.010	while having visions of a childhood that he never had in the year of 2017. 
0057_00.01.19.010-00.01.26.640	In the year 1984, the scenes in this film seem to be unfolding just as they did in the first film.
0057_00.01.26.650-00.01.27.850	However, we see the T-800 is then attacked
0057_00.01.27.850-00.01.28.920	by an older T-800
0057_00.01.28.920-00.01.33.080	and is eventually shot
0057_00.01.33.080-00.01.37.210	and defeated, which did not happen in the first film.
0057_00.01.37.210-00.01.40.430	It turns out that the T-800 that we see now was sent back in time to when Sarah was nine years old,
0057_00.01.40.430-00.01.43.200	and after her parents were killed,
0057_00.01.43.200-00.01.45.110	this T-800 Terminator has been training and prepping her for this day.
0057_00.01.45.150-00.01.50.540	Sarah is not the untrained, scared woman that we see in the first film,
0057_00.01.50.540-00.01.53.040	but now she is a confident and trained warrior,
0057_00.01.53.040-00.01.55.580	showing that this is a different past from the previous films.
0057_00.01.55.580-00.02.00.360	As this T-800 raised her, she frequently refers to him as Pa,
0057_00.02.00.360-00.02.03.150	but he is credited as the Guardian,
0057_00.02.03.150-00.02.07.580	as his primary objective is to protect Sarah Connor
0057_00.02.07.580-00.02.10.280	and ensure that she gives birth to John Connor, so one day he can lead the Resistance.
0057_00.02.10.280-00.02.12.660	Kyle arrives to 1984 shortly after,
0057_00.02.12.660-00.02.17.630	and is almost immediately attacked by a T-1000 Terminator,
0057_00.02.17.630-00.02.20.300	very similar to the model from the second film.
0057_00.02.20.300-00.02.22.970	Sarah and the Guardian rescue Kyle
0057_00.02.22.970-00.02.25.570	and the T-1000 pursues them,
0057_00.02.25.570-00.02.28.390	which they are eventually able to lead into a trap
0057_00.02.28.390-00.02.30.180	where they douse him in acid. 
0057_00.02.30.180-00.02.40.390	Sarah and the Guardian reveal that they have constructed their own time machine and plan to use it to travel to the year 1997, which is the year Skyney became self-aware in the second Terminator film.
0057_00.02.40.390-00.02.43.060	Kyle realizes, however, that the timeline has been altered
0057_00.02.43.060-00.02.46.680	because he remembers being born in a world that wasn't destroyed by machines,
0057_00.02.46.680-00.02.51.460	where his original timeline began in the apocalyptic world. 
0057_00.02.51.460-00.02.57.670	Kyle convinces Sarah to travel to the year 2017 in order to stop Skynet. 
0057_00.02.57.670-00.03.05.440	The time machine that they travel in requires that no artificial fibers or materials be present; therefore they must travel naked to the year 2017,
0057_00.03.05.440-00.03.08.470	and the Guardian will wait for their arrival and provide them with clothing.
0057_00.03.08.470-00.03.10.110	Kyle and Sarah materialize in the middle of traffic in San Francisco,
0057_00.03.10.110-00.03.13.860	which does cause a small explosion,
0057_00.03.13.860-00.03.16.090	leading to their arrest,
0057_00.03.16.090-00.03.17.510	and the Guardian is unable to make it there in time
0057_00.03.17.930-00.03.19.560	before they are apprehended.
0057_00.03.19.560-00.03.22.280	Kyle and Sarah are taken to the hospital
0057_00.03.22.280-00.03.23.870	to be treated for their wounds,
0057_00.03.23.870-00.03.25.970	and it is revealed that the new Skynet is called Genesys,
0057_00.03.25.970-00.03.30.770	which is an operating system that will interlock all forms of communication, transportation, and government,
0057_00.03.30.770-00.03.34.510	which is set to go live very soon.
0057_00.03.34.510-00.03.38.600	While still at the hospital, John Connor appears
0057_00.03.38.600-00.03.40.780	and rescues Kyle and Sarah.
0057_00.03.40.780-00.03.42.670	The Guardian arrives
0057_00.03.42.670-00.03.44.580	and begins shooting John,
0057_00.03.44.580-00.03.47.360	and it is revealed that John is no longer human,
0057_00.03.47.360-00.03.49.490	but is a hybrid T-3000 unit.
0057_00.03.49.490-00.03.54.030	It is revealed that while Kyle was sent back in time, John was attacked by a T-5000 unit,
0057_00.03.54.030-00.03.56.580	which is the physical embodiment of Skynet.
0057_00.03.56.580-00.04.00.770	It transformed John on a cellular level
0057_00.04.00.770-00.04.03.490	into the T-3000 Terminator,
0057_00.04.03.500-00.04.05.580	and John was sent back to ensure the survival of Cyberdyne Systems
0057_00.04.05.580-00.04.07.170	and the release of Genesys.
0057_00.04.07.170-00.04.10.710	Sarah, Kyle, and the Guardian are able to escape,
0057_00.04.10.710-00.04.16.120	and prepare to destroy the Genesys programming before its scheduled public release.
0057_00.04.16.120-00.04.17.950	They are chased down by John
0057_00.04.17.950-00.04.21.430	but eventually make their way to the Cyberdyne campus. 
0057_00.04.21.430-00.04.27.220	The schedule for the Genesys Project gets moved forward in order to release the program before it is destroyed.
0057_00.04.27.220-00.04.29.800	They plant explosives around the facility
0057_00.04.29.800-00.04.33.750	while the Genesys System tries to talk to them, first appearing as a young boy,
0057_00.04.33.750-00.04.36.660	but eventually appearing as the T-5000 unit that initially attacked John.
0057_00.04.36.660-00.04.41.130	John arrives and battles with the Guardian,
0057_00.04.41.140-00.04.44.560	and eventually the Guardian is able to trap John in the Cyberdine's prototype time machine.
0057_00.04.44.560-00.04.48.250	The machine is activated,
0057_00.04.48.250-00.04.49.950	and as they both have exposed inorganic materials,
0057_00.04.49.950-00.04.52.480	it causes a massive explosion, destroying John,
0057_00.04.52.490-00.04.55.430	and the Guardian is thrown
0057_00.04.55.430-00.04.59.680	into a vat of mimetic polyalloy, similar to the silver-like structure of the T-1000 unit.
0057_00.04.59.680-00.05.02.790	As the campus is exploding,
0057_00.05.02.790-00.05.05.790	Kyle and Sarah lock themselves in a bunker,
0057_00.05.05.790-00.05.07.350	sparing their lives from the explosion,
0057_00.05.07.370-00.05.10.470	knowing they have stopped Genesys from being released.
0057_00.05.10.470-00.05.16.570	The Guardian arrives, now upgraded with the mimetic poly components, and helps guide them through the debris. 
0057_00.05.16.570-00.05.19.470	They then travel to the home of Kyle's younger self
0057_00.05.19.470-00.05.30.360	so he can implant a memory and a reminder that Genesys is Skynet in order to give Kyle the memory to know to come to the year 2017 when he is older.
0057_00.05.30.360-00.05.34.230	The three
0057_00.05.34.230-00.05.36.530	then drive off into the countryside, initially seeming as though they have sucessfully defeated Genesys.
0057_00.05.36.530-00.05.44.370	However, in a scene during the credits, it is revealed that the core of Genesys was protected
0057_00.05.44.370-00.05.50.680	and survived the explosion; this should set up for the films that are planned to follow, however they aren't 100% confirmed when they will be released.
0058_00.00.32.490-00.00.42.080	Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, he's a billionaire genius that has no actual powers, but incredibly advanced technology that helps him fight bad guys.
0058_00.00.42.080-00.00.48.410	Thor, aka Pretty Boy, from Asgard, the God of Thunder, who carries a hammer that cannot be moved.
0058_00.00.48.415-00.00.50.545	Bruce Banner, aka The Hulk, a scientist
0058_00.00.50.545-00.00.56.330	that when he gets angry, becomes a massive, green creature that is nearly invincible.
0058_00.00.56.330-00.01.06.700	Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, a genetically enhanced man from the 1940's that was frozen for 70 years and is sometimes a bit out of touch with modern times.
0058_00.01.06.710-00.01.18.380	Clint Barton, aka Hawkeye, a new character to the modern Marvel movie universe, who does not have his own individual movie, and frankly no one really cares about him.
0058_00.01.18.380-00.01.23.210	Hawkeye's weapon of choice is a bow and arrow, but does not have any real specific superpowers.
0058_00.01.23.210-00.01.31.370	Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, honestly, safe for maybe Pretty Boy Thor, she's the best looking member of the Avengers.
0058_00.01.31.370-00.01.32.170	UNMATCHED:  She also does not have her own movie, but I'd definitely watch it if she did.
0058_00.01.32.180-00.01.40.900	She's a highly trained former Soviet spy, who is a master assassin and seductress.
0058_00.01.40.900-00.01.50.400	Nick Fury, while not an actual Avenger, he is the director of Shield, an organization that is sort of like a souped-up CIA that sometimes uses superheroes.
0058_00.01.50.400-00.01.57.610	The Avengers work as a part of Shield.
0058_00.01.57.610-00.01.58.910	UNMATCHED:  Now that we're explained who is part of the team, let's get to the story.
0058_00.01.58.910-00.02.01.985	The movie begins with Thor's not-so-nice brother, Loki.
0058_00.02.01.990-00.02.06.700	Loki meets a character called The Other, 
0058_00.02.06.700-00.02.09.360	who is the leader of an alien race known as the Chitauri.
0058_00.02.09.365-00.02.13.535	If Loki gets an object called the tesseract from Sheild and gives it to The Other, 
0058_00.02.13.535-00.02.17.745	The Other will give Loki an army capable of taking over Earth.
0058_00.02.17.750-00.02.25.780	The tesseract has been seen in quite a few other Marvel movies, especially in the first Captain America movie.
0058_00.02.25.780-00.02.26.420	UNMATCHED: I will be doing a summary of those movies explaining the history a bit more so make sure to check them out. 
0058_00.02.26.420-00.02.33.680	The tesseract is an infinity stone.
0058_00.02.33.680-00.02.34.240	UNMATCHED: For more in-depth explanation of what infinity stones are, check out my Guardians of the Galaxy movie summary.
0058_00.02.34.250-00.02.43.570	The main thing to know about the tesseract is it's a cube of great power 
0058_00.02.43.570-00.02.49.630	and The Other wants it so he can give it to his master, Thanos.
0058_00.02.49.630-00.02.50.290	UNMATCHED:  Nearly all of the recent Marvel movies at least on some level have been influenced by Thanos, but we have only seen glimpses of him.
0058_00.02.50.290-00.03.00.490	Thanos is going to be playing a big role in the future and his desire to get his hands on the infinity stones is very important.
0058_00.03.00.495-00.03.06.785	Loki breaks into the Shield headquarters and ends up capturing the tesseract
0058_00.03.06.785-00.03.12.715	as well as mind controlling a good amount of Shield scientists, including Dr. Erik Selig, the professor from the Thor movies,
0058_00.03.12.715-00.03.15.330	as well as Hawkeye.
0058_00.03.15.330-00.03.20.150	Nick Fury escapes this attack and works to get the Avengers together, which does take a bit of convincing.
0058_00.03.20.160-00.03.28.870	The mind-controlled Hawkeye ends up stealing iridium, that is needed to stabilize the tesseract, 
0058_00.03.28.870-00.03.32.155	while at the same time, Loki makes a very loud and obvious distraction.
0058_00.03.32.155-00.03.35.155	Loki is captured by the Avengers and taken to Shield's ship,
0058_00.03.35.155-00.03.37.935	known as the Helicarrier,
0058_00.03.37.935-00.03.42.225	 however, the tesseract is still hidden away from the Avengers.
0058_00.03.42.225-00.03.51.695	After some investigating, the Avengers learn that Shield wants the tesseract cube so they can weaponize it, 
0058_00.03.51.695-00.03.52.580	UNMATCHED:  which starts a big argument between the agents of Shield and the members of the Avengers.
0058_00.03.52.580-00.03.58.640	While arguing the mind-controlled Hawkeye and several others of Loki's crew attack the helicarrier.
0058_00.03.58.645-00.04.00.615	A big fight breaks out,
0058_00.04.00.615-00.04.02.165	Loki escapes, 
0058_00.04.02.165-00.04.06.125	and Hawkeye is knocked unconscious, which breaks him from his mind control.
0058_00.04.06.130-00.04.07.830	The Avengers attempt to recover, 
0058_00.04.07.830-00.04.10.370	while Loki puts the final parts of his plan into action.
0058_00.04.10.370-00.04.14.070	The still mind-controlled Dr. Selvig has set up the tesseract on the roof of a building in New York City, 
0058_00.04.14.070-00.04.18.940	which he uses to open up a massive wormhole.
0058_00.04.18.940-00.04.27.120	From the wormhole, a giant army of Chitauri pours in, the same army that The Other promised to Loki for capturing the tesseract.
0058_00.04.27.120-00.04.32.220	A huge fight breaks out between Loki's army and the Avengers.
0058_00.04.32.225-00.04.37.915	The US government attempts to use a nuclear missile to destroy the whole city of New York, in order to prevent the attack from spreading, 
0058_00.04.37.915-00.04.42.205	but Iron Man takes the missile through the wormhole, 
0058_00.04.42.205-00.04.47.120	causing it to detonate on the other side in a galaxy far away.
0058_00.04.47.120-00.04.50.160	The explosion causes the wormhole to close and Iron Man falls back to Earth.
0058_00.04.50.170-00.04.57.660	Loki is defeated in a rather brutal way by The Hulk, 
0058_00.04.57.660-00.04.58.230	UNMATCHED: and then Thor takes both Loki and the tesseract back to Asgard.
0059_00.00.27.725-00.00.30.415	The film opens with a group of thugs wearing clown masks robbing a bank,
0059_00.00.30.415-00.00.37.595	however, during the job, each member begins to kill one another one by one.
0059_00.00.37.595-00.00.40.985	The remaining robber reveals himself to be the Joker, a crazed supervillian, 
0059_00.00.40.985-00.00.44.570	and escapes the bank in a school bus.
0059_00.00.44.570-00.00.52.450	The District Attorney of Gotham, Harvey Dent, is leading a campaign against organized crime and is heralded by the citizens of Gotham.
0059_00.00.52.450-00.00.55.440	Dent begins to investigate other banks that are also suspected of having mob ties.
0059_00.00.55.440-00.00.57.300	UNMATCHED
0059_00.00.57.300-00.01.00.940	Several mob leaders hold a conference,
0059_00.01.00.940-00.01.01.850	which is interrupted by the Joker.
0059_00.01.01.850-00.01.07.010	The Joker offers to kill Batman in exchange for half of a large sum of money that was stolen from the mob bosses
0059_00.01.07.010-00.01.09.910	by a Chinese man, named Lau,
0059_00.01.09.910-00.01.11.240	that they were in the process of recovering.
0059_00.01.11.250-00.01.12.360	After the Joker shows a feat of his strangeness
0059_00.01.12.360-00.01.17.610	and his strength, they hire the Joker.
0059_00.01.17.615-00.01.18.955	Batman finds Lau
0059_00.01.18.955-00.01.21.845	and brings him back to the city of Gotham

0059_00.01.22.685-00.01.27.990	and Dent is able to put 549 criminals in custody under the RICO law.
0059_00.01.27.990-00.01.35.580	In response, the Joker begins to kill people and promises to continue to do so until the Batman reveals himself.
0059_00.01.35.590-00.01.40.240	The Joker tries to kill the mayor, but Jim Gordon sacrifices himself to save the mayor.
0059_00.01.40.245-00.01.43.775	Dent then discovers that Rachel, Dent's girlfriend 
0059_00.01.43.775-00.01.44.575	and Batman's former love interest, 
0059_00.01.44.575-00.01.47.030	is the Joker's next target.

0059_00.01.49.910-00.01.53.880	but Dent publicly states that he is Batman before Bruce is able to.

0059_00.02.00.730-00.02.04.580	are able to rescue Dent and arrest the Joker.

0059_00.02.27.780-00.02.32.075	realizing that he was tricked by the Joker and is actually at Dent's location.
0059_00.02.32.075-00.02.34.995	Batman pulls Dent from the building,
0059_00.02.34.995-00.02.38.535	which does explode, 
0059_00.02.38.535-00.02.40.730	and half of Dent's face becomes disfigured and he is hospitalized.
0059_00.02.40.730-00.02.45.520	Gordon, who was actually sent to save Rachel, is unable to make it there in time and Rachel dies.

0059_00.03.00.165-00.03.02.835	and publicly claims that he knows his identity.
0059_00.03.02.835-00.03.05.015	The joker says he no longer wants to know who Batman is 
0059_00.03.05.015-00.03.07.035	and threatens to destroy a hospital if Reese isn't killed.

0059_00.03.11.115-00.03.13.330	and heads to secure Reese.

0059_00.03.15.980-00.03.20.240	and manipulates him into seeking revenge for Rachel's death.

0059_00.03.28.780-00.03.31.280	including Maroni, one of the largest mobsters in Gotham.
0059_00.03.31.280-00.03.36.080	This is where we truly see Dent become the famous Batman villian, Two Face.
0059_00.03.36.080-00.03.38.580	Later that night, The Joker rigs two ferries
0059_00.03.38.580-00.03.40.910	with explosives.

0059_00.03.52.560-00.03.53.150	UNMATCHED:  The Joker promises to blow up both of the ferries, unless one of the ferries decides to destroy the other.
0059_00.03.53.160-00.03.57.620	The passengers on both ferries refuse, 
0059_00.03.57.620-00.04.02.400	and Batman is able to capture the Joker and stop him.
0059_00.04.02.410-00.04.07.240	The Joker gloats that he has corrupted Dent and that has undone all of the good work that Dent has done.

0059_00.04.13.870-00.04.15.630	and Dent falls to his death.

0059_00.04.24.560-00.04.26.410	Gordon is reluctant but agrees
0059_00.04.26.410-00.04.31.270	and the film ends with a manhunt for Batman beginning.
0060_00.00.30.820-00.00.37.280	The film takes place eight years after the previous movie, with Gotham police eradicating organized crime.

0060_00.01.53.365-00.01.54.710	so Bruce has Miranda Tate take over the company.

0061_00.00.22.490-00.00.26.610	led by President Snow.
0061_00.00.26.610-00.00.29.780	Panem is divided into two primary regions: The Capitol, which is a the wealthy and ruling nation,
0061_00.00.29.780-00.00.33.040	and the districts.
0061_00.00.33.040-00.00.39.070	The districts are the poor regions, divided into twelve separate districts, based off of the resources that they provide to the Capitol.
0061_00.00.39.080-00.00.46.120	Life in the districts vary by district to district, primarily getting worse the higher the number the district, but all the districts are pretty much poorer than the Capitol. 
0061_00.00.46.120-00.00.54.150	In the history of Panem, many years ago, the districts tried to rise up against the Capitol and failed.
0061_00.00.54.150-00.00.56.450	As punishment for the Rebellion, the Capitol instituted a yearly event
0061_00.00.56.450-00.00.57.450	known as the Hunger Games.
0061_00.00.57.450-00.01.03.000	The Hunger Games is a challenge where one boy and one girl from all twelve districts, ages twelve to eighteen,
0061_00.01.03.000-00.01.06.030	are chosen as tributes to compete in a battle to the death.
0061_00.01.06.030-00.01.14.990	Only one survivor comes out alive, and they do receive a handsome reward, but the horror of being forced into a murderous and dangerous situation typically scars the victors.
0061_00.01.14.990-00.01.18.210	These events are televised and highly publicized. 
0061_00.01.18.210-00.01.21.910	In the Capitol, they are exciting, fun games to watch;
0061_00.01.21.910-00.01.26.370	while those in the districts watch in horror as their children are murdered or killed.
0061_00.01.26.370-00.01.28.230	The film follows Katniss Everdeen,
0061_00.01.28.230-00.01.32.460	a citizen of District 12, who volunteers in place of her sister, Prim.
0061_00.01.32.460-00.01.35.450	She is also joined by Peeta, the male District 12 tribute. 
0061_00.01.35.450-00.01.37.580	They are escorted from District 12 by their chaperone, Effie Trinket, who is from the Capitol,
0061_00.01.37.580-00.01.40.080	and acclimates them to the customs,
0061_00.01.40.080-00.01.42.650	showmanship,
0061_00.01.42.650-00.01.45.980	and conferences that will occur before the Hunger Games.
0061_00.01.45.980-00.01.50.540	Katniss makes a very big presence in the pregame events, gaining a great deal popularity.
0061_00.01.50.540-00.01.58.290	They are also joined by their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, who is an alcoholic and a past victor of the Hunger Games. 
0061_00.01.58.290-00.02.01.240	At the Capitol, Katniss and Peeta meet the tributes from the other districts
0061_00.02.01.240-00.02.03.990	-- some who are friendly, some who are not -- 
0061_00.02.03.990-00.02.04.570	and they begin their training for the Games.
0061_00.02.04.570-00.02.07.360	Katniss has a history of bow skills,
0061_00.02.07.360-00.02.12.460	having spent a great deal of time hunting with her friend and possible romantic interest, Gale. 
0061_00.02.12.460-00.02.22.040	However, prior to the Games, and during the Games, Peeta and Katniss start to develop a "for-TV" relationship in order to win some favor from the audience.
0061_00.02.22.040-00.02.23.530	However, this relationship is not real. 
0061_00.02.23.540-00.02.27.660	The Games begin,
0061_00.02.27.660-00.02.28.950	and it becomes a series of different tributes either dying from crazy environmental conditions,
0061_00.02.28.950-00.02.33.490	insane wildlife such as giant poisonous bugs known as tracker jackers,
0061_00.02.33.490-00.02.35.840	or being killed by other tributes.
0061_00.02.35.840-00.02.37.990	Temporary alliances are made and broken,
0061_00.02.37.990-00.02.42.120	and at the end of every day, the tributes who have died are announced. 
0061_00.02.42.120-00.02.46.790	Haymitch is able to convince Crane, the Head Gamemaker, to allow there to be one male and one female victor.
0061_00.02.46.790-00.02.50.450	This would allow both Peeta and Katniss to win,
0061_00.02.50.450-00.02.52.580	which the audience wants
0061_00.02.52.580-00.02.54.480	because of their fake relationship. 
0061_00.02.54.480-00.02.56.620	Katniss and Peeta are the last remaining tributes,
0061_00.02.56.620-00.03.00.240	both having either watched people die or having killed people themselves,
0061_00.03.00.240-00.03.01.540	and now believe that they have won.
0061_00.03.01.550-00.03.06.650	However, it is announced that there will only be one winner, and Peeta and Katniss will have to fight to the death.
0061_00.03.06.650-00.03.12.790	In a desperate attempt, Katniss convinces Peeta to eat some poisonous nightlock berries with her, which would kill both of them. 
0061_00.03.12.790-00.03.14.120	She knows that this will force the Gamemakers to intervene, as there has to be a living winner,
0061_00.03.14.140-00.03.18.450	so the Gamemakers stop them
0061_00.03.18.450-00.03.22.410	and make both Katniss and Peeta the winners of the Hunger Games. 
0061_00.03.22.410-00.03.26.480	Katniss is warned that her act of defiance has gained her some enemies. 
0061_00.03.26.480-00.03.34.160	Head Gamemaker Crane is locked in a room with a bowl of nightlock berries by President Snow, presumably to kill himself as punishment for allowing two winners.
0061_00.03.34.160-00.03.37.610	Katniss and Peeta are returned back to District 12,
0061_00.03.37.610-00.03.42.290	and they try to forget the events of the Hunger Games.
0062_00.00.31.030-00.00.34.640	The film picks up right where the previous film ended, with Katniss recovering
0062_00.00.34.640-00.00.36.370	after being attacked
0062_00.00.36.370-00.00.37.450	by the brainwashed Peeta.
0062_00.00.37.450-00.00.39.540	The rebels fight in District 2, disabling their weapons.  
0062_00.00.39.550-00.00.42.660	While trying to rally the troops against the Capitol,
0062_00.00.42.660-00.00.44.700	Katniss is shot
0062_00.00.44.700-00.00.45.540	and injured.
0062_00.00.45.540-00.00.48.640	At first, the injured Katniss is told she cannot battle,
0062_00.00.48.650-00.00.52.230	but she sneaks onto a supply ship anyway.
0062_00.00.52.230-00.00.53.910	Katniss is assigned to a group
0062_00.00.53.910-00.00.54.570	including Gale,
0062_00.00.54.570-00.00.55.330	Finnick,
0062_00.00.55.330-00.00.56.540	a film crew, 
0062_00.00.56.540-00.00.59.440	and a variety of other soldiers.
0062_00.00.59.450-00.01.03.240	The goal is for the group to stay behind the main wave of troops
0062_00.01.03.240-00.01.05.370	and film propaganda footage to rally even more troops.
0062_00.01.05.370-00.01.06.860	The leader of the group, Boggs, 
0062_00.01.06.860-00.01.09.450	carries a holographic map called the Holo, 
0062_00.01.09.450-00.01.16.190	which is supposed to help them avoid various booby traps, known as pods, which are littered throughout the Capitol.  
0062_00.01.16.190-00.01.21.490	Peeta is sent to join the squad, even though he has not fully recovered from his brainwashing.
0062_00.01.21.490-00.01.23.610	As the group travels into the Capitol, 
0062_00.01.23.610-00.01.26.310	they trigger various pods 
0062_00.01.26.310-00.01.29.200	and several of the group members are killed,
0062_00.01.29.200-00.01.30.900	including its leader, Boggs.
0062_00.01.30.900-00.01.32.280	Before he dies,
0062_00.01.32.280-00.01.35.210	Boggs gives Katniss the Holo in hopes that she will be able to avoid
0062_00.01.35.220-00.01.38.550	the majority of the remaining pods.
0062_00.01.38.550-00.01.41.890	Katniss convinces the surviving members that she is on a secret mission
0062_00.01.41.890-00.01.43.410	to kill Snow,
0062_00.01.43.410-00.01.47.190	and they continue to push into the Capitol,
0062_00.01.47.190-00.01.52.530	while being attacked by more pods and the Capitol's Peacekeepers, and more of the group continues to die.
0062_00.01.52.540-00.01.56.090	At one point, the Capitol believes that they are successful in killing Katniss,
0062_00.01.56.090-00.01.57.560	which they announce publicly,
0062_00.01.57.560-00.02.02.560	and President Coin delivers a eulogy in order to rally the rebels.
0062_00.02.02.560-00.02.07.610	Katniss's group travels into the sewers in hopes of avoiding some of the pods,
0062_00.02.07.610-00.02.09.660	but they are attacked by genetically engineered creatures.
0062_00.02.09.660-00.02.12.530	Some of the members of their group are killed,
0062_00.02.12.530-00.02.16.240	including Finnick, one of the previous Hunger Games winners.
0062_00.02.16.250-00.02.17.290	Katniss uses the Holo's self-destruct feature
0062_00.02.17.290-00.02.21.520	in order to take out a large portion of the creatures.
0062_00.02.21.520-00.02.23.110	Once out of the sewers,
0062_00.02.23.110-00.02.25.870	the group is pursued by more Peacekeepers,
0062_00.02.25.870-00.02.28.540	and they hide in a store owned by Tigris,
0062_00.02.28.540-00.02.30.870	a former Hunger Games stylist,
0062_00.02.30.870-00.02.32.980	who provides them shelter and disguises.
0062_00.02.32.980-00.02.36.620	President Snow offers the fleeing Capitol citizens 
0062_00.02.36.620-00.02.38.610	to take refuge at his mansion,
0062_00.02.38.610-00.02.42.080	which Katniss and Gale use as an opportunity to enter the mansion.
0062_00.02.42.080-00.02.45.250	As they try to enter the mansion in disguise,
0062_00.02.45.250-00.02.47.570	the Rebels arrive 
0062_00.02.47.570-00.02.49.730	and begin fighting with the Capitol Peacekeepers.
0062_00.02.49.740-00.02.51.690	A hovercraft flies overhead,
0062_00.02.51.700-00.02.55.360	dropping small parcels into an area with young children from the Capitol,
0062_00.02.55.360-00.02.57.860	which detonate, killing all of the children. 
0062_00.02.57.860-00.03.02.290	A team of Rebel medics rush in to help,
0062_00.03.02.290-00.03.03.360	including Katniss's sister, Prim.
0062_00.03.03.360-00.03.07.270	However, as the group rushes in to help,
0062_00.03.07.270-00.03.08.910	a second wave of bombs explode, killing Prim
0062_00.03.08.910-00.03.11.030	and knocking out Katniss.
0062_00.03.11.030-00.03.13.910	After Katniss recovers, 
0062_00.03.13.910-00.03.16.910	she finds out that the Capitol has been taken over by the Rebels
0062_00.03.16.910-00.03.19.410	and Snow has been captured.
0062_00.03.19.410-00.03.22.740	Katniss meets with Snow,
0062_00.03.22.740-00.03.27.620	where Snow explains that the attack that killed Prim was in fact done by the Rebels and President Coin, not by the Capitol.  
0062_00.03.27.620-00.03.32.940	Katniss doubts him, but Snow reminds Katniss of an earlier promise he made not to lie to her.
0062_00.03.32.940-00.03.48.950	This scene actually relates back to a part earlier in the film, were Gale describes a similar attack of causing a small explosion to take out a small group, then a big group of people rush in, and cause a second explosion to maximize the casualties.
0062_00.03.48.950-00.03.57.500	This leads the viewers to think that the attack could possibly not be caused by the Capitol, but a vicious attack from the Rebels, which caused casualties on both sides. 
0062_00.03.57.500-00.04.01.660	This is important to consider, because remember,
0062_00.04.01.660-00.04.04.700	the entire reason Katniss got involved with the Hunger Games was to protect her sister Prim,
0062_00.04.04.700-00.04.07.720	who may have just been killed by the Rebels who she was working with.  
0062_00.04.07.720-00.04.12.370	Katniss approaches Gale to ask him if the attack was really orchestrated by the Rebels,
0062_00.04.12.370-00.04.17.070	and Gale is unable to assure her that it wasn't from the Rebels.
0062_00.04.17.070-00.04.21.580	Katniss then cuts off all ties with Gale, assuming that the attack really was caused by them.
0062_00.04.21.580-00.04.24.830	President Coin celebrates her victory,
0062_00.04.24.830-00.04.28.280	and has the former Hunger Games winners come to a meeting,
0062_00.04.28.280-00.04.37.630	where she proposes a new Hunger Games, where the former citizens of the Capitol must send their own children into, in order to pay for what they did to the children in the Districts.
0062_00.04.37.630-00.04.39.940	They vote on the idea,
0062_00.04.39.940-00.04.41.730	and Katniss gives the swing vote in favor,
0062_00.04.41.730-00.04.46.610	in exchange that Katniss will be able to execute Snow personally.
0062_00.04.46.620-00.04.48.360	At the public execution,
0062_00.04.48.360-00.04.54.330	instead of killing Snow, Katniss shoots and kills Coin in revenge for her sister Prim's death.
0062_00.04.54.330-00.04.58.780	The Rebels then arrest Katniss, 
0062_00.04.58.780-00.05.00.150	while an angry mob kills Snow.
0062_00.05.00.150-00.05.02.160	Katniss is eventually pardoned for her crime
0062_00.05.02.160-00.05.04.570	and is returned to District 12.
0062_00.05.04.570-00.05.06.580	A new President is elected.
0062_00.05.06.590-00.05.10.370	Katniss goes on to eventually marry Peeta,
0062_00.05.10.370-00.05.14.040	as well as has two children with him,
0062_00.05.14.040-00.05.18.660	and the film ends as she reflects on the nightmares of her past, thinking on how there are much worse games to play.
0062_00.05.18.660-00.05.22.780	To add a quick point of clarification: this film doesn't really end on a happy note.
0062_00.05.22.780-00.05.28.230	Katniss lost her sister, the one who she was fighting for,
0062_00.05.28.230-00.05.30.700	and has pretty severe PTSD and trauma
0062_00.05.30.700-00.05.33.670	from the two Hunger Games she was in, as well as the Rebellion that she fought in.
0062_00.05.33.670-00.05.38.690	While some found this ending to be a bit dissatisfying, it definitely is more realistic
0062_00.05.38.690-00.05.43.450	for somebody who has participated and seen the atrocities that Katniss did,
0062_00.05.43.450-00.05.46.610	as well as having lost the main person that she was fighting for.
0063_00.00.15.620-00.00.17.190	The film takes place in the year 2035,
0063_00.00.17.190-00.00.20.280	with the Ares III crew
0063_00.00.20.280-00.00.22.120	exploring the surface of Mars.
0063_00.00.22.120-00.00.23.740	A dust storm
0063_00.00.23.740-00.00.25.270	forces them to evacuate the planet
0063_00.00.25.270-00.00.26.300	and return to the orbiting vessel,
0063_00.00.26.300-00.00.28.330	Hermes.
0063_00.00.28.330-00.00.29.870	However, during the evacuation,
0063_00.00.29.870-00.00.31.080	astronaut
0063_00.00.31.080-00.00.32.240	and botanist Mark Watney
0063_00.00.32.240-00.00.33.870	is struck by some debris
0063_00.00.33.870-00.00.35.040	and lost in the storm,
0063_00.00.35.040-00.00.36.660	and is presumed dead.
0063_00.00.36.660-00.00.37.640	The rest of the crew
0063_00.00.37.640-00.00.40.830	leaves the planet, unable to search for Watney.
0063_00.00.40.830-00.00.42.830	Watney awakens after the storm
0063_00.00.42.830-00.00.45.650	due to a low oxygen warning
0063_00.00.45.650-00.00.47.400	and is able to make his way back to the base.
0063_00.00.47.400-00.00.50.810	His suit was damaged in the storm, 
0063_00.00.50.810-00.00.51.290	UNMATCHED: which caused his life support readings to show him as dead.
0063_00.00.51.290-00.00.56.210	Watney realizes that he is now alone
0063_00.00.56.210-00.00.59.440	and will have to wait four years for the next NASA crew to come and find him.
0063_00.00.59.440-00.01.02.450	He also realizes the Hermes team has no idea that he is alive.
0063_00.01.02.450-00.01.08.710	Watney does some calculations and realizes that he only has enough food to last him 309 days,
0063_00.01.08.710-00.01.11.950	primarily with a diet based on potatoes,
0063_00.01.11.950-00.01.15.160	and needs to find a way to make more food in order to survive.
0063_00.01.15.160-00.01.18.520	Watney uses his skills as a botanist
0063_00.01.18.520-00.01.21.870	to find a way to make a hospital environment for the crops inside of the base,
0063_00.01.21.870-00.01.24.670	utilizing a variety of devices and clever tools.
0063_00.01.24.670-00.01.27.330	Back on Earth,
0063_00.01.27.330-00.01.28.790	after a viewing satellite photos,
0063_00.01.28.790-00.01.31.160	NASA realizes that Watney has survived. 
0063_00.01.31.160-00.01.33.280	NASA, however, decides initially to not inform
0063_00.01.33.290-00.01.35.950	Watney's crew aboard the Hermes,
0063_00.01.35.950-00.01.38.980	as they still believe that Watney died on Mars and finding out that they left him would make it so the crew
0063_00.01.38.980-00.01.42.080	is unable to complete their mission.
0063_00.01.42.080-00.01.43.160	Watney finds a way
0063_00.01.43.160-00.01.44.530	using the Pathfinder probe,
0063_00.01.44.530-00.01.48.290	which is been silent since 1997, 
0063_00.01.48.290-00.01.50.830	to communicate with NASA through a very rudimentary system.
0063_00.01.50.830-00.01.54.150	Eventually Watney, through the help of NASA,
0063_00.01.54.160-00.01.58.110	is able to set up a sort of e-mail system,
0063_00.01.58.110-00.02.00.110	which he can more efficiently communicate with NASA.
0063_00.02.00.110-00.02.03.280	Watney finds out that the crew is unaware of his survival and is furious.
0063_00.02.03.280-00.02.05.370	Then NASA decides to inform 
0063_00.02.05.370-00.02.08.040	the Hermes crew,
0063_00.02.08.040-00.02.09.360	and they are shocked by what they find out.
0063_00.02.09.360-00.02.11.620	NASA works quickly
0063_00.02.11.620-00.02.12.990	to build a rocket
0063_00.02.12.990-00.02.14.740	with enough food to supplement Watney until the next Mars landing.
0063_00.02.14.740-00.02.17.080	UNMATCHED: But in their haste, the ship is improperly built,
0063_00.02.17.080-00.02.19.990	and the ship explodes after takeoff.
0063_00.02.20.000-00.02.23.990	The story of Watney being trapped on Mars has now become a global affair. 
0063_00.02.23.990-00.02.25.070	The China National Space Administration
0063_00.02.25.070-00.02.27.970	offers to help NASA,
0063_00.02.27.970-00.02.29.560	giving them technology
0063_00.02.29.580-00.02.31.830	for a classified booster rocket.
0063_00.02.31.830-00.02.35.120	Through a series of events, the crew aboard the Hermes decides
0063_00.02.35.120-00.02.39.130	instead of landing back on Earth, they will use the Chinese booster to resupply the Hermes
0063_00.02.39.130-00.02.43.200	and the crew heads back to Mars,
0063_00.02.43.200-00.02.46.020	which should be an eighteen month journey.
0063_00.02.46.040-00.02.47.160	UNMATCHED: The Hermes crew plans to travel close to Mars,
0063_00.02.47.160-00.02.53.660	and Watley will use a short range vessel known as the MAV to travel off of Mars's surface
0063_00.02.53.660-00.02.55.190	in order to rendezvous with the Hermes.
0063_00.02.55.190-00.02.56.990	Watney does some serious modifications to the MAV,
0063_00.02.56.990-00.02.59.120	pretty much stripping it down to the bare bones,
0063_00.02.59.120-00.03.01.290	in order to reduce its mass
0063_00.03.01.290-00.03.03.830	to help him travel further into space.
0063_00.03.03.830-00.03.06.950	The Hermes crew remotely controls the MAV,
0063_00.03.06.950-00.03.08.190	as the extreme G-forces
0063_00.03.08.190-00.03.10.620	knock Watley unconscious as he leaves the atmosphere.
0063_00.03.10.620-00.03.12.980	When Watney awakes,
0063_00.03.12.990-00.03.14.660	he uses a nitrogen gas propelled pac
0063_00.03.14.660-00.03.17.070	to push himself away from the MAV, 
0063_00.03.17.070-00.03.19.600	but still is too far away from the Hermes.
0063_00.03.19.600-00.03.21.910	He then pierces his glove of his pressure suit
0063_00.03.21.910-00.03.23.790	and uses the escaping air
0063_00.03.23.790-00.03.25.370	to thrust him closer to the Hermes.
0063_00.03.25.370-00.03.27.280	The crew intercepts him,
0063_00.03.27.280-00.03.31.230	and as NASA and the whole world listen, they rejoice upon hearing that he is safe.
0063_00.03.31.230-00.03.34.280	The film ends showing the crew several years later in their new lives,
0063_00.03.34.280-00.03.41.830	with Watney returning to be a survival instructor, training new astronaut candidates.
0064_00.00.16.410-00.00.18.410	The film opens with a teenage male named Thomas
0064_00.00.18.410-00.00.20.730	being lifted up from an underground elevator
0064_00.00.20.740-00.00.24.290	with no memory of his past, except for his name.
0064_00.00.24.290-00.00.28.760	When he reaches the surface he finds himself on a glade,
0064_00.00.28.770-00.00.30.410	where he meets a group of teenage boys
0064_00.00.30.410-00.00.31.700	known as the Gladers,
0064_00.00.31.700-00.00.33.070	who also have no memories
0064_00.00.33.070-00.00.35.250	except for their own names.
0064_00.00.35.250-00.00.38.330	The Glade has developed into a society structured by various labor activities,
0064_00.00.38.330-00.00.40.020	from growing food,
0064_00.00.40.030-00.00.41.650	medicine,
0064_00.00.41.650-00.00.43.450	and another group known as Runners.
0064_00.00.43.450-00.00.44.870	Thomas discovers
0064_00.00.44.870-00.00.49.700	that the Glade is surrounded by a labyrinth of high walls referred to as the Maze. 
0064_00.00.49.700-00.00.53.200	Every morning the Maze opens
0064_00.00.53.200-00.00.55.540	and the Runners try to solve the Maze before nightfall happens,
0064_00.00.55.540-00.00.58.390	where the entrances from the Glade into the Maze close.
0064_00.00.58.390-00.01.03.200	At night, in the closed Maze, dangerous mechanical spider-creatures roam the Maze.
0064_00.01.03.200-00.01.07.730	No one has ever survived a night in the Maze,
0064_00.01.07.740-00.01.08.550	which is why the Runners return before nightfall.
0064_00.01.08.550-00.01.11.190	The maze is also ever-changing,
0064_00.01.11.190-00.01.12.610	with multiple different combinations,
0064_00.01.12.610-00.01.14.120	so the Runners must become aware
0064_00.01.14.120-00.01.16.660	of the different variations.
0064_00.01.16.660-00.01.18.540	Shortly after Thomas's arrival,
0064_00.01.18.540-00.01.22.660	a girl arrives on the elevator to the Glade,
0064_00.01.22.660-00.01.24.060	the first girl ever to be brought to the Glade.
0064_00.01.24.060-00.01.26.270	Shortly after arriving, she appears to recognize Thomas
0064_00.01.26.270-00.01.27.740	and falls into a coma.
0064_00.01.27.740-00.01.30.910	The other members of the Glade ask Thomas if he remembers her,
0064_00.01.30.910-00.01.32.220	and he has an unclear flashback,
0064_00.01.32.220-00.01.34.870	realizing he does know her.
0064_00.01.34.870-00.01.37.450	It is later revealed that her name is Teresa.
0064_00.01.37.450-00.01.41.250	Teresa's arrival is pretty significant, however,
0064_00.01.41.250-00.01.43.140	as she arrives with a note saying "She's the last one ever",
0064_00.01.43.150-00.01.47.820	implying that no more people or supplies will be brought to the Glade.
0064_00.01.47.830-00.01.49.860	On top of that, the doors to the Glade into the Maze
0064_00.01.49.870-00.01.52.650	now stay open at night,
0064_00.01.52.660-00.01.54.640	allowing the robot spiders known as Grievers,
0064_00.01.54.640-00.01.56.320	to enter into the Glade
0064_00.01.56.330-00.01.57.330	and attack the Gladers.
0064_00.01.57.330-00.01.59.620	A large portion of the Gladers decide to make a run for it
0064_00.01.59.620-00.02.02.030	into the Maze,
0064_00.02.02.040-00.02.04.880	using some of the technology from a destroyed Griever
0064_00.02.04.880-00.02.07.290	to enter into a secret passageway that leads into
0064_00.02.07.290-00.02.08.810	an observatory lab.
0064_00.02.08.810-00.02.11.610	They discover that the whole maze was actually some form of experiment
0064_00.02.11.610-00.02.20.240	created by an organization called World In Catastrophe: Killzone Experiment Department, a.k.a. WICKED.
0064_00.02.20.250-00.02.25.320	However, their reason for placing the Gladers into this experiment is not exactly clear,
0064_00.02.25.320-00.02.29.350	though it seems to be related to a near-apocalyptic outside world, caused by an event known as the Flare,
0064_00.02.29.350-00.02.32.480	which killed off half of the world's population.
0064_00.02.32.480-00.02.35.350	It appears as though that the lab was destroyed
0064_00.02.35.350-00.02.40.190	and a large portion of the scientists and operators who were monitoring the Gladers
0064_00.02.40.200-00.02.41.650	were killed by a rebel group.
0064_00.02.41.650-00.02.43.000	One of the Gladers,
0064_00.02.43.000-00.02.44.900	Gally,
0064_00.02.44.900-00.02.47.120	who never really trusted Thomas,
0064_00.02.47.120-00.02.49.480	arrives to the lab and tries to kill Thomas.
0064_00.02.49.480-00.02.50.010	UNMATCHED: Another Glader jumps in front of the knife
0064_00.02.50.010-00.02.51.870	and sacrifices his life.
0064_00.02.51.870-00.02.55.650	The Gladers are suddenly rescued by armed rebels
0064_00.02.55.650-00.02.59.490	and are are flown in helicopters to a supposed safe haven.
0064_00.02.59.490-00.03.06.000	However, in the films epilogue, it appears that the rebel group actually may be part of the experiment,
0064_00.03.06.000-00.03.11.820	and that they are only taking the Gladers to the next trial to continue testing them,
0064_00.03.11.820-00.03.12.230	UNMATCHED: and that the Gladers are not the only group being tested.
0065_00.00.15.847-00.00.18.037	The film is based on the premise that in the future,
0065_00.00.18.037-00.00.21.410	robots will take over the world and try to eradicate mankind.
0065_00.00.21.410-00.00.23.390	The majority of the film is set in Los Angeles in the year 1984
0065_00.00.23.390-00.00.28.490	where 2 beings have just arrived from the future.
0065_00.00.28.490-00.00.30.720	One is a Terminator T800, 
0065_00.00.30.720-00.00.32.830	played by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
0065_00.00.32.830-00.00.34.990	Terminators are a type of robot with many different versions,
0065_00.00.34.990-00.00.40.690	designed to kill humans in the future.
0065_00.00.40.690-00.00.47.040	This Terminator was sent back to kill Sarah Connor, because in the future, she will give birth to a son who will be the leader of the human resistance against the machines.
0065_00.00.47.040-00.00.51.050	The other being that has arrived is Kyle Reese,
0065_00.00.51.050-00.00.53.740	a human resistance member who was sent to protect Sarah Connor.
0065_00.00.53.745-00.00.57.445	The Terminator begins to attack and kill every woman named Sarah Connor,
0065_00.00.57.445-00.01.01.310	 as he does not know exactly what the real Sarah Connor looks like.
0065_00.01.01.310-00.01.03.660	Kyle Reese is able to locate the real Sarah Connor
0065_00.01.03.660-00.01.05.650	using a picture he was given,
0065_00.01.05.650-00.01.08.200	and tells her that there is a defense network, known as Skynet,
0065_00.01.08.200-00.01.15.385	 that will eventually become self-aware and start a nuclear holocaust, wiping out a large portion of the human race.
0065_00.01.15.385-00.01.18.005	The humans were nearing victory against the machines in the future,
0065_00.01.18.005-00.01.24.940	 so the robots sent the Terminator to kill Sarah Connor so her future son, John Connor, would never be able to lead the resistance.
0065_00.01.24.940-00.01.28.480	Initially, Sarah does not believe Kyle, 
0065_00.01.28.480-00.01.33.120	but after the Terminator attacks and they escape a few times, she starts to believe.
0065_00.01.33.120-00.01.35.660	At some point, the 2 devevlop a romantic connection
0065_00.01.35.660-00.01.37.640	and have sex with one another.
0065_00.01.37.645-00.01.39.025	The Terminator finds them again
0065_00.01.39.025-00.01.45.830	and they go into a factory where the final battle begins.
0065_00.01.45.830-00.01.47.460	Kyle is using pipe bombs to fight the Terminator and shoves one into the Terminator's abdomen
0065_00.01.47.460-00.01.50.850	which explodes and kills Kyle
0065_00.01.50.850-00.01.53.010	and severey damages the Terminator.
0065_00.01.53.010-00.01.55.200	The damaged Terminator still tries to attack Sarah,
0065_00.01.55.200-00.01.58.450	but she crushes the Terminator with a hydraulic press, 
0065_00.01.58.450-00.01.59.770	finally destroying it.
0065_00.01.59.775-00.02.03.355	The film ends showing Sarah, 7 months later,
0065_00.02.03.355-00.02.06.125	pregnant, with Kyle being the father.
0065_00.02.06.125-00.02.09.395	She has been recording audio tapes for her unborn son, John, 
0065_00.02.09.395-00.02.11.095	and has a picture taken,
0065_00.02.11.095-00.02.13.190	 the same picture that Kyle had at the beginning of the film.
0065_00.02.13.190-00.02.16.990	She then drives off into the approaching storm.
0066_00.00.17.225-00.00.18.655	In the past, Bor, 
0066_00.00.18.655-00.00.19.415	father of Odin,
0066_00.00.19.415-00.00.21.365	clashes with the dark elf, Malekith, 
0066_00.00.21.365-00.00.24.690	who seeks to unleash a weapon, known as the Aether, on the nine realms.
0066_00.00.24.690-00.00.26.740	After conquering his forces,
0066_00.00.26.740-00.00.29.890	Bor safeguards the Aether within a stone column.
0066_00.00.29.895-00.00.32.895	Unknown to Bor, Malekith and a handful of dark elves escape
0066_00.00.32.895-00.00.35.240	 into suspended animation.
0066_00.00.35.245-00.00.37.205	In present day Asgard,

0066_00.00.45.910-00.00.48.310	and portals linking the worlds appear at random.
0066_00.00.48.310-00.00.51.350	In London, Dr. Jane Foster and Darcy Lewis
0066_00.00.51.350-00.00.54.840	travel to an abandoned factory where such portals have appeared.
0066_00.00.54.840-00.00.58.340	Jane is teleported into another world where she is infected by the Aether.
0066_00.00.58.340-00.01.00.580	Thor brings her to Asgard, 
0066_00.01.00.580-00.01.03.620	where Odin warns the Aether heralds a catastrophic prophesy.
0066_00.01.03.625-00.01.06.695	Malekith, awakened by the Aether's release,
0066_00.01.06.695-00.01.08.655	attacks Asgard.

0066_00.01.11.965-00.01.13.410	and the dark elves flee.
0066_00.01.13.410-00.01.15.880	Thor enlists the help of Loki to use a portal to confront Malekith.
0066_00.01.15.885-00.01.18.775	As Malekith draws the Aether out of Jane, 
0066_00.01.18.775-00.01.20.510	Thor attempts to destroy it, but fails.
0066_00.01.20.510-00.01.24.060	Malekith emerges with the Aether and leaves.
0066_00.01.24.060-00.01.25.990	Loki is fatally wounded.
0066_00.01.25.995-00.01.28.495	Thor and Jane discover a portal in a nearby cave
0066_00.01.28.495-00.01.31.985	and reunite in London with Darcy and Dr. Erik Selvig.
0066_00.01.31.990-00.01.35.070	They learn that Malekith's plan is to restore the dark elves.
0066_00.01.35.075-00.01.38.485	Thor battles Malekith through various portals and across multiple worlds

0066_00.01.57.715-00.02.01.190	Odin's form transforms into Loki, who is alive and impersonating Odin.

0067_00.00.43.745-00.00.46.535	being trapped inside of a tomb in ancient Egypt.

0067_00.00.51.365-00.00.54.495	 including the ability to channel and upgrade other mutants' powers.
0067_00.00.54.500-00.01.02.445	Apocalypse wakes up in the year 1983 and he believes that humanity has lost its way and that the world needs to be cleansed of humanity and remade.

0067_00.01.51.455-00.01.53.865	This is also the same MacTaggert from the first class film,
0067_00.01.53.865-00.01.55.540	 that Xavier had a love interest with.
0067_00.01.55.540-00.01.57.990	The film transitions to Magneto,

0067_00.02.41.335-00.02.44.195	The captured mutants eventually break out
0067_00.02.44.195-00.02.50.165	with the help of a brainwashed Wolverine, aka Weapon X, who at this point in the timeline, is unaware of who the X-Men are.
0067_00.02.50.165-00.02.52.525	Jean restores a portion of Wolverine's memory
0067_00.02.52.525-00.02.54.410	and he flees.
0067_00.02.54.410-00.03.02.870	Magneto begins to use his powers to control the Earth's magnetic poles, causing massive destruction and death across the entire planet.
0067_00.03.02.870-00.03.07.560	Apocalypse attempts to steal Xavier's body so he can gain his telepathic powers,
0067_00.03.07.560-00.03.10.350	but Xavier is able to send a distress call to Jean and the other students
0067_00.03.10.350-00.03.12.870	and is saved before his powers are stolen.
0067_00.03.12.870-00.03.18.040	The X-Men begin to fight with Apocalypse and his lieutenants in a destroyed Cairo.
0067_00.03.18.040-00.03.19.550	Angel is defeated.
0067_00.03.19.550-00.03.24.845	Eventually Storm and Magneto decide to turn on Apocalypse and help fight with the X-Men.
0067_00.03.24.850-00.03.27.580	Xavier begins a telepathic battle with Apocalypse 
0067_00.03.27.580-00.03.32.710	and eventually Jean joins in, unleashing her full power as the Phoenix 
0067_00.03.32.710-00.03.33.120	UNMATCHED:  (see the X-Men Last Stand for more info),
0067_00.03.33.120-00.03.37.470	 and Apocalypse is eventually defeated.
0067_00.03.37.470-00.03.39.660	Psylocke flees after the fight.
0067_00.03.39.660-00.03.42.200	Xavier and MacTaggert rekindle their relationship.
0067_00.03.42.200-00.03.45.040	Magneto and Jean rebuild the school.
0067_00.03.45.040-00.03.48.110	The film ends with the X-Men training in the simulation.
0067_00.03.48.110-00.03.53.560	In a post-credits scene, we see men from the Essex Corporation retrieving the data from Stryker's facility, 
0067_00.03.53.560-00.03.56.830	including a blood sample from Weapon X.
0067_00.03.56.830-00.04.03.700	This is a reference to Mr. Sinister, an X-Men villian and probably will play some part in future X-Men films.
0067_00.04.03.700-00.04.11.730	One last thing that I wanted to point out is that the film sort of makes Magneto out as an ok-ish guy by the end of the film after he turns on Apocalypse.
0067_00.04.11.730-00.04.15.730	My issue with this is the devastation we see in the film.
0067_00.04.15.730-00.04.19.790	It's reasonable to say literally hundreds of millions of people died because of what Apocalypse and Magneto did.
0067_00.04.19.790-00.04.25.020	Cairo was completely destroyed, which has a population of well over 10 million people.
0067_00.04.25.020-00.04.26.330	UNMATCHED:  I don't normally put my opinion in these spoilers, but it really bothered me that everyone seems kind of ok with Magneto by the end of the film, where he played a crucial part in killing a minimum of 100 million people
0067_00.04.26.330-00.04.36.560	UNMATCHED
0067_00.04.36.570-00.04.37.380	UNMATCHED:  This is something that often is ignored in superhero films, except for maybe Civil War and is extremely frustrating to me.
0067_00.04.37.380-00.04.42.330	UNMATCHED
0067_00.04.42.330-00.04.44.480	UNMATCHED:  I just thought I'd share my 2 cents about that.
0068_00.00.24.300-00.00.27.790	The film opens in 1944 German-occupied Poland, 
0068_00.00.27.790-00.00.33.475	with 13 year old Eric Lehnsherr, who is separated from his parents at a concentration camp.
0068_00.00.33.475-00.00.37.275	While Eric is reaching out to his Mother, 
0068_00.00.37.275-00.00.40.320	he causes metal gates to twist and bend through the use of magnetic force.
0068_00.00.40.320-00.00.45.410	Decades later, we find a world where mutants are just beginning to be discovered.
0068_00.00.45.410-00.00.49.660	Mutants are humans with genetic evolutions that allow them a variety of superpowers.
0068_00.00.49.660-00.01.00.770	We find U.S. Senator Robert Kelly trying to pass the Mutant Registration Act through Congress, which would force mutants to publicly reveal their identities and their powers.
0068_00.01.00.770-00.01.03.870	At the Congressional meeting, a much older Eric, now known as Magneto,
0068_00.01.03.875-00.01.11.610	as well as the telepath, Professor Charles Xavier, discuss their different views on the relationships between humans and mutants.
0068_00.01.11.615-00.01.15.525	The film transitions to a 17 year old, named Marie,
0068_00.01.15.525-00.01.21.790	who discovers that she is a mutant by accidentally putting her boyfriend into a coma just by kissing him.
0068_00.01.21.790-00.01.26.910	She later discovers that she has the ability to absorb life force and mutant abilities from anyone she touches.
0068_00.01.26.920-00.01.32.410	Out of fear of being persecuted, she changes her name to Rogue and runs away to Canada.

0068_00.01.36.650-00.01.38.320	and who has superhuman healing abilities, 
0068_00.01.38.320-00.01.41.950	heightened strength and senses, as well as metal claws that protrude from his knuckles.
0068_00.01.41.960-00.01.44.080	They travel on the road together, 
0068_00.01.44.080-00.01.47.120	where they are attacked by another mutant, named Sabretooth, 
0068_00.01.47.120-00.01.48.240	who works for Magneto.
0068_00.01.48.240-00.01.51.480	Rogue and Wolverine are saved by two other mutants, 
0068_00.01.51.480-00.01.53.790	Cyclops, who has lasers that shoot from his eyes, 
0068_00.01.53.790-00.01.57.110	and Storm, who can control the weather.
0068_00.01.57.115-00.01.58.735	They bring Rogue and Wolverine back to a school in New York,
0068_00.01.58.735-00.02.01.295	ran by Professor Xavier.
0068_00.02.01.295-00.02.05.525	Xavier explains that it's a school for mutants
0068_00.02.05.525-00.02.11.110	which also houses a group known as the X-Men, a group who seeks peace with the human race.
0068_00.02.11.110-00.02.14.910	They also work to prevent Magneto from escalating the war between humans and mutants. 
0068_00.02.14.910-00.02.16.520	Magneto has Senator Kelly abducted by two mutants, 
0068_00.02.16.520-00.02.18.830	Toad, 
0068_00.02.18.830-00.02.21.580	and the shape-shifter, Mystique.
0068_00.02.21.580-00.02.28.120	Magneto uses Kelly as a test subject for a machine that artificially induces mutation to try to turn Kelly into a mutant.
0068_00.02.28.120-00.02.31.480	Kelly uses his new abilities to escape his imprisonment.
0068_00.02.31.485-00.02.33.785	Back at the school, Rogue is convinced by the shape-shifter, Mystique, 
0068_00.02.33.785-00.02.36.415	who is disguised as a classmate,
0068_00.02.36.415-00.02.38.370	 to leave the school.
0068_00.02.38.370-00.02.42.540	Xavier uses a special mutant-locating machine, called Cerebro,
0068_00.02.42.540-00.02.44.080	to find Rogue at the train station.
0068_00.02.44.080-00.02.46.200	As the X-Men leave to go find Rogue,
0068_00.02.46.200-00.02.49.790	Mystique sabotages the Cerebro machine.
0068_00.02.49.790-00.02.53.620	At the train station, Wolverine tries to convince Rogue to stay, 
0068_00.02.53.620-00.02.56.860	but a fight ensues with Magneto, Toad and Sabretooth.

0068_00.02.59.415-00.03.00.545	and leaves.

0068_00.03.04.665-00.03.09.245	and died shortly after, turning into a puddle of water.
0068_00.03.09.245-00.03.13.705	The X-Men realize that Magneto wants to use his artificial mutation machine on a much larger scale
0068_00.03.13.705-00.03.16.905	and affect thousands of people at a World Leaders Summit.
0068_00.03.16.905-00.03.21.365	The problem is that Magneto nearly died using his machine when he was testing it the first time, 
0068_00.03.21.365-00.03.27.575	so he plans to use Rogue after copying his abilities to trigger the machine,
0068_00.03.27.575-00.03.29.245	killing Rogue instead of killing Magneto.
0068_00.03.29.245-00.03.31.915	Xavier attempts to locate Rogue using Cerebro,
0068_00.03.31.915-00.03.36.200	but Mystique's sabotage causes him to fall into a coma.
0068_00.03.36.200-00.03.42.290	The telepath, Jean Grey, repairs Cerebro and uses the machine
0068_00.03.42.290-00.03.43.830	to locate Magneto on Liberty Island.
0068_00.03.43.830-00.03.45.450	The X-Men scaled the Statue of Liberty.

0068_00.04.18.490-00.04.21.530	As the film begins to conclude, we see Xavier has recovered
0068_00.04.21.530-00.04.24.820	and that Mystique is still alive, impersonating Senator Kelly.
0068_00.04.24.820-00.04.32.080	Xavier tells Wolverine he has discovered a secret military base that may have some information on Wolverine's past.

0069_00.00.41.320-00.00.42.740	by virtually invincible robots called Sentinels.
0069_00.00.42.745-00.00.46.325	The Sentinels have Mystique's powers of transformation 
0069_00.00.46.325-00.00.48.525	which they obtained after she was captured

0069_00.00.51.245-00.00.53.275	A group of mutants, some from the previous film,
0069_00.00.53.275-00.00.55.275	some new,
0069_00.00.55.275-00.00.57.280	are in a hideout in remote China.
0069_00.00.57.280-00.01.03.570	A mutant named Kitty Pryde is able to send Wolverine back to 1973, 
0069_00.01.03.570-00.01.09.230	so he can prevent Mystique from assassinating Dr. Trask, which will eventually lead to her capture and the creation of Sentinels.
0069_00.01.09.230-00.01.15.910	In 1973, Wolverine finds the younger Xavier and Beast.
0069_00.01.15.920-00.01.19.170	Xavier has been using a serum that allows him to walk but prevents him from being able to use his telepathic powers.

0069_00.01.22.610-00.01.23.660	and gets Xavier to free Magneto, 
0069_00.01.23.660-00.01.27.410	who's in prison below the Pentagon for assassinating John F. Kennedy.
0069_00.01.27.420-00.01.28.900	Once Magneto is freed, 
0069_00.01.28.900-00.01.31.990	they travel to get Mystique
0069_00.01.31.990-00.01.33.400	and get to her just as she's about to kill Dr. Trask.
0069_00.01.33.400-00.01.35.200	Magneto and Mystique escape.
0069_00.01.35.210-00.01.36.130	Dr.Trask lives

0069_00.01.50.685-00.01.52.940	which allows him to control the Sentinels.

0069_00.02.26.455-00.02.29.070	and allows Mystique and Magneto to escape.
0069_00.02.29.070-00.02.35.550	Mystique's actions are seen as a positive for mutants and Dr. Trask is arrested for selling military secrets.
0069_00.02.35.550-00.02.39.200	By doing this, the mutants that are seen in the beginning of the film that are in the future,
0069_00.02.39.200-00.02.41.240	are no longer being pursued by Sentinels.
0069_00.02.41.240-00.02.42.170	Wolverine wakes up in the future
0069_00.02.42.170-00.02.45.730	and finds all other mutants are alive,

0069_00.02.46.820-00.02.48.830	and Cyclops, who died in the third X-Men film.
0069_00.02.48.840-00.02.54.170	This split creates the new timeline that we see in the X-Men cinematic universe.
0069_00.02.54.170-00.03.00.160	In a post-credit scene, we see a crowd chanting to the ultra powerful mutant, named Apocalypse, 
0069_00.03.00.160-00.03.03.070	 who is using telekinesis to build pyramids
0069_00.03.03.070-00.03.05.910	as four horsemen watch nearby.
0069_00.03.05.910-00.03.09.540	This is hinting at the next film, X-Men Apocalypse.
0070_00.00.47.330-00.00.49.700	The film opens in 1945, 
0070_00.00.49.700-00.00.55.580	where Wolverine/Logan is being held in a Japanese POW camp.

0070_00.00.57.865-00.01.01.120	and Logan saves a Japanese officer, named Ichiro Yashida.

0070_00.01.14.575-00.01.17.040	and who works for Yashida, the officer that Logan saved.
0070_00.01.17.040-00.01.24.110	Yashida is dying from cancer and wants to meet with Logan to repay Logan for saving his life.
0070_00.01.24.110-00.01.33.400	Yoshida wants to transfer Logan's self-healing powers to himself, to get rid of the cancer that Yoshida has, which will in turn end Logan's immortality, which Logan views as a burden.
0070_00.01.33.400-00.01.37.950	Logan refuses the offer, however, 
0070_00.01.37.950-00.01.46.730	and while sleeping, Yashida's physician, Dr. Greene, who's also known as the mutant, Viper, introduces something into Logan's body.
0070_00.01.46.730-00.01.50.410	The next morning, Logan is told that Yoshida has died.

0070_00.02.03.950-00.02.14.330	Logan finds out that Mariko's fiance is behind the kidnapping, and that he has conspired with Mariko's father to have her killed because Mariko is the heir to the Yashida company, not Mariko's father.
0070_00.02.14.330-00.02.18.660	Logan discovers that a robot was placed inside his body and is suppressing his ability to heal.
0070_00.02.18.665-00.02.20.705	He cuts into himself 
0070_00.02.20.705-00.02.23.240	and removes the robot but momentarily dies.

0070_00.02.26.280-00.02.28.290	but Logan recovers and kills Mariko's father.

0070_00.02.31.110-00.02.34.660	but is eventually captured by a group of ninjas.

0070_00.02.37.160-00.02.40.660	who reveals that she plans to take Logan's powers
0070_00.02.40.660-00.02.43.620	and put them inside of a massive exoskeleton, called the Silver Samurai, 
0070_00.02.43.620-00.02.46.870	which has a sword made of adamantium, the same metal that is in Logan's claws.
0070_00.02.46.875-00.02.50.615	Yukio arrives and kills Dr. Greene, 
0070_00.02.50.615-00.02.52.875	and Logan battles the Silver Samurai.

0070_00.02.54.155-00.02.58.330	and the Silver Samurai begins to steal Logan's healing factor.
0070_00.02.58.330-00.03.05.200	It is then revealed that the Silver Samurai is actually Yashida, who did not actually die from cancer, 
0070_00.03.05.200-00.03.07.980	and is now trying to steal Logan's powers to become the ultimate warrior.
0070_00.03.07.980-00.03.14.090	Mariko stabs her grandfather, Yashida, using one of Logan's severed adamantium claws
0070_00.03.14.090-00.03.20.270	and Logan is able to recover, regrow his bone claws and kills Yashida, ending the fight.
0070_00.03.20.270-00.03.22.830	Later on, Mariko becomes CEO of the Yashida Industries
0070_00.03.22.830-00.03.26.280	and says goodbye to Logan.
0070_00.03.26.285-00.03.30.155	In the mid-credit scene, we see Logan is back in the United States, 
0070_00.03.30.155-00.03.33.410	talking with Magneto in an airport 
0070_00.03.33.415-00.03.35.365	to discuss a dangerous threat that has returned, 
0070_00.03.35.365-00.03.37.665	hinting at the next film, X-Men, Days of Future Past.
0070_00.03.37.670-00.03.40.910	Logan also finds out that Xavier is still alive,
0070_00.03.40.910-00.03.44.850	who Logan watched die in the third film.
0071_00.00.40.240-00.00.46.450	The film opens 20 years earlier, with Professior Xavier and Magneto meeting with a young Jean Grey at her parents house,
0071_00.00.46.450-00.00.52.070	discovering that she has extraordinary powers, even for a mutant.
0071_00.00.52.075-00.00.56.285	We then see 10 years later, at the apartment of an industrialist leader named Worthington, 
0071_00.00.56.285-00.00.59.295	whose young son is trying to cut off his mutant wings.
0071_00.00.59.295-00.01.04.785	The film then transitions to present day, where Worthington's company has developed a vaccine
0071_00.01.04.785-00.01.08.995	that will suppress the x-gene that gives mutants their abilities, offering a cure of sorts to mutants who want it.
0071_00.01.09.000-00.01.11.150	UNMATCHED
0071_00.01.11.150-00.01.15.435	The cure is created from a young mutant named Jimmy who can suppress mutant abilities.
0071_00.01.15.435-00.01.16.325	Jimmy lives at the Worthington facility,
0071_00.01.16.325-00.01.19.440	that is on Alcatraz Island.
0071_00.01.19.440-00.01.20.790	Some mutants are very interested in the cure, 
0071_00.01.20.790-00.01.23.290	such as Rogue,
0071_00.01.23.290-00.01.27.150	who is completely incapable of human contact due to her powers.
0071_00.01.27.155-00.01.30.615	Other mutants, however, are horrified by the idea that they are curing mutation, 
0071_00.01.30.615-00.01.33.830	and Magneto is especially upset.
0071_00.01.33.830-00.01.37.490	Magneto establishes the Brotherhood of Mutants to fight against the cure,
0071_00.01.37.490-00.01.42.280	as he believes that the cure will soon be given forcibly to all mutants.
0071_00.01.42.280-00.01.45.110	Magneto and his Brotherhood attack a mobile prison
0071_00.01.45.110-00.01.48.540	to help Mystique escape,
0071_00.01.48.540-00.01.51.810	as well as two other mutants: Juggernaut, who is an unstoppable man, 
0071_00.01.51.810-00.01.55.770	and Multiple Man, who can make many copies of himself.
0071_00.01.55.775-00.01.58.995	The prison guards carry special guns armed with the mutant cure,
0071_00.01.58.995-00.02.02.785	and fire a round at Magneto, but Mystique takes the bullet instead, 
0071_00.02.02.785-00.02.06.870	turning herself into a human without powers.
0071_00.02.06.870-00.02.09.040	Magneto abandons Mystique, 
0071_00.02.09.040-00.02.09.990	as she is only a human now,
0071_00.02.09.990-00.02.11.700	which upsets Mystique.
0071_00.02.11.710-00.02.14.660	Cyclops, upset over Jean's death,
0071_00.02.14.660-00.02.18.190	travels to the lake from the second film where she died.
0071_00.02.18.195-00.02.20.165	Jean suddenly appears to Cyclops, 
0071_00.02.20.165-00.02.23.450	but as they kiss, Jean disintegrates Cyclops.
0071_00.02.23.450-00.02.25.580	Professor Xavier senses that something is wrong, 
0071_00.02.25.580-00.02.28.380	and sends Wolverine and Storm to investigate.
0071_00.02.28.380-00.02.31.370	However, the lake is now experiencing some extremely odd properties, such as objects randomly floating around,
0071_00.02.31.370-00.02.37.870	along with Cyclops' glasses 
0071_00.02.37.870-00.02.39.490	and an unconscious Jean.
0071_00.02.39.495-00.02.47.605	Back at the mansion, Xavier explains that when Jean sacrificed herself during the events of the second film,
0071_00.02.47.605-00.02.55.410	she released an alternate personality, Phoenix, a powerful animalistic personality that Xavier had suppressed, fearing Phoenix's destructive potential.
0071_00.02.55.410-00.03.00.740	Wolverine is initially disgusted when he hears what Xavier did to Jean at such a young age, 
0071_00.03.00.740-00.03.07.170	but when Jean wakes up, it becomes clear that she is no longer the same Jean, 
0071_00.03.07.175-00.03.07.585	and that she had killed Cyclops.
0071_00.03.07.585-00.03.09.790	Phoenix knocks out Wolverine
0071_00.03.09.790-00.03.11.405	and escapes to her childhood home.

0071_00.03.14.615-00.03.20.395	and Magneto and his Brotherhoood, along with Xavier and the X-Men, arrive at the same time to Jean's home.
0071_00.03.20.400-00.03.22.790	Both groups try to get Jean's loyalty, 
0071_00.03.22.790-00.03.26.450	until the Phoenix personality resurfaces.
0071_00.03.26.450-00.03.27.990	Phoenix destroys the house,
0071_00.03.27.990-00.03.31.830	disintegrates and kills Xavier,
0071_00.03.31.830-00.03.33.950	and leaves with Magneto and the Brotherhood.
0071_00.03.33.950-00.03.36.470	The Brotherhood attack Worthington Labs
0071_00.03.36.470-00.03.38.730	to destroy those who make the cure
0071_00.03.38.730-00.03.41.140	and the mutant that the Cure is made from.
0071_00.03.41.150-00.03.45.950	At the same time, Mystique flipped on Magneto and provided information to the government, 
0071_00.03.45.950-00.03.49.870	which they use to attack the Brotherhood camp,
0071_00.03.49.870-00.03.54.390	however, when they arrive, it is only just filled with copies of the Multiple Man.
0071_00.03.54.395-00.03.58.865	Magneto uses his magnetic powers to move the Golden Gate bridge
0071_00.03.58.865-00.04.02.315	to connect to Alcatraz, where the labs are located.
0071_00.04.02.315-00.04.04.865	The Brotherhood attack the island
0071_00.04.04.865-00.04.07.910	and the remaining X-Men try to help the military in fighting the Brotherhood.

0071_00.04.09.990-00.04.12.950	is able to save the mutant, Jimmy, 
0071_00.04.12.950-00.04.15.240	before Juggernaut can kill him.

0071_00.04.17.945-00.04.20.865	to distract him long enough for another mutant, named Beast, to inject Magneto with the cure,
0071_00.04.20.865-00.04.24.660	stripping Magneto of all of his powers.
0071_00.04.24.660-00.04.28.220	Wolverine tries to calm down Jean/Phoenix.
0071_00.04.28.220-00.04.32.690	The army shoots at Jean, awakening the Phoenix
0071_00.04.32.690-00.04.35.080	and she disintegrates the troops
0071_00.04.35.080-00.04.41.230	and begins to destroy Alcatraz and nearly everyone around her.
0071_00.04.41.230-00.04.44.230	Wolverine pleads with her, only able to survive due to his healing abilities.
0071_00.04.44.230-00.04.50.905	Jean begs Wolverine to kill her, as she knows she is losing control to Phoenix.
0071_00.04.50.905-00.04.53.455	Wolverine fatally stabs Jean, destroying Phoenix

0071_00.04.55.835-00.05.00.705	As the film concludes, we see mutants have more legally established rights
0071_00.05.00.705-00.05.05.910	and the Xavier school is still operating with Storm as the new headmistress.
0071_00.05.05.910-00.05.11.360	The President of the United States appoints Beast to be an ambassador for the United Nations.

0071_00.05.13.235-00.05.17.620	and her boyfriend, Bobby, is upset with her decision.
0071_00.05.17.620-00.05.22.240	Before the rolling of the credits, we see Magneto sitting at a chessboard, similar to the ending of the first film.
0071_00.05.22.245-00.05.25.915	He gestures towards a metal chess piece and it twitches slightly, 
0071_00.05.25.915-00.05.28.780	suggesting his powers are coming back.
0071_00.05.28.780-00.05.38.990	In a post-credit scene, we see Dr. Mctaggert, who is briefly mentioned earlier in the film, in the context of placing one person's mind inside the body of another.
0071_00.05.39.000-00.05.48.050	A patient who is in comatose greets the Doctor with the voice of Xavier, implying Xavier somehow transferred his consciousness and is not truly dead.
0072_00.00.34.355-00.00.39.325	The film opens in 1944 with the young Magneto, known at this time as Erik,
0072_00.00.39.325-00.00.43.265	having bent the metal gates at a Nazi concentration camp,

0072_00.01.28.815-00.01.30.230	and a teleporter.
0072_00.01.30.230-00.01.35.870	Quick note:  Moira MacTaggert is the same doctor seen in the post credits scenes of X-Men The Last Stand.

0072_00.01.38.915-00.01.42.585	in order to try to persuade the government to move nuclear missiles to Turkey.

0072_00.03.20.120-00.03.25.790	which backfires, causing him to turn blue and grow hair, where he becomes the character, better known as Beast.

0072_00.03.47.355-00.03.53.160	he must avenge his Mother and kills Shaw by forcing the Nazi coin from his childhood through Shaw's brain.

0073_00.02.05.785-00.02.10.085	who asks if they want to join a military mutant group, called Team X.
0073_00.02.10.085-00.02.15.335	Remember, Stryker is one of the main antagonists of the X2 film, 
0073_00.02.15.335-00.02.16.045	UNMATCHED:  which if you need a reminder, please check out my summary.
0073_00.02.16.045-00.02.20.205	They joined the group,
0073_00.02.20.205-00.02.21.985	but James, now going by the name Logan, leaves the group because of their disregard for human life,
0073_00.02.21.985-00.02.25.665	especially seen with his brother, Victor.
0073_00.02.25.665-00.02.29.145	Six years later, Logan is working as a lumberjack in Canada,
0073_00.02.29.145-00.02.31.080	where he lives with his girlfriend, Kayla.
0073_00.02.31.080-00.02.37.620	Stryker approaches Logan, saying that two other members of Team X have been killed, and he thinks someone is targeting the team members.

0073_00.02.41.610-00.02.44.110	but soon, Logan finds his girlfriend's bloody body,
0073_00.02.44.110-00.02.45.905	knowing that this was Victor's doing.
0073_00.02.45.905-00.02.48.325	Logan finds Victor,
0073_00.02.48.325-00.02.49.375	but loses the fight.
0073_00.02.49.375-00.02.52.115	Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue
0073_00.02.52.115-00.02.56.615	and offers to help Logan to become strong enough to fight Victor.
0073_00.02.56.620-00.03.03.870	Logan goes through an incredibly painful procedure and has his skeleton reinforced with adamantium, a virtually indestructable metal.
0073_00.03.03.870-00.03.06.830	Stryker, however, tries to betray Logan, ordering his memory to be erased, 
0073_00.03.06.830-00.03.10.830	which Logan overhears and escapes.
0073_00.03.10.830-00.03.14.950	A member of Team X, Agent Zero, tracks down Logan, but Logan kills him.
0073_00.03.14.960-00.03.21.790	Logan locates two other former members of Team X, 
0073_00.03.21.790-00.03.25.100	who explain that Victor is actually working for Stryker 
0073_00.03.25.100-00.03.27.700	and is hunting down mutants for an experiment at Stryker's labratory, called The Island.
0073_00.03.27.700-00.03.31.680	They refer Logan to a mutant who escaped The Island, Gambit, in order to find the location of The Island.
0073_00.03.31.680-00.03.34.900	Logan finds Gambit,
0073_00.03.34.900-00.03.38.620	and fights with Victor again, 
0073_00.03.38.620-00.03.40.200	who kills one of the Team X members 
0073_00.03.40.200-00.03.41.870	and extracts his DNA.

0073_00.03.44.215-00.03.46.335	which is located on Three Mile Island.

0073_00.03.49.740-00.03.53.010	and was keeping tabs on him for Stryker
0073_00.03.53.010-00.03.55.080	in exchange for protection for her sister's life.
0073_00.03.55.085-00.03.57.395	Kayla is actually also a mutant with several abilities, 
0073_00.03.57.395-00.04.01.705	including the ability to control anyone she touches.
0073_00.04.01.710-00.04.16.940	Stryker activates his experiment, which is a mutant that he made from a combination of DNA from other mutants, putting them into Wade Wilson, calling him Weapon 11, which he also refers to as the Deadpool, because he is a combination of other dead mutants.
0073_00.04.16.940-00.04.26.280	It should be noted that this Deadpool is in many ways drastically different than the Deadpool we see in the 2016 film, though they are both played by Ryan Reynolds.
0073_00.04.26.280-00.04.30.515	This Deadpool has a variety of powers and is nearly unstoppable.
0073_00.04.30.520-00.04.36.310	Logan and Victor team up and eventually Logan is able to decapitate Deadpool,
0073_00.04.36.310-00.04.39.570	but one of the cooling towers is destroyed in the process.

0073_00.04.46.065-00.04.49.490	and then they are eventually rescued by Professor Xavier.
0073_00.04.49.490-00.04.52.740	Stryker shoots Logan in the head with an adamantium bullet,
0073_00.04.52.740-00.04.55.740	rendering him unconscious.
0073_00.04.55.740-00.04.57.910	Stryker then turns the gun on Kayla,
0073_00.04.57.910-00.05.01.690	 but she is able to use her abilities to persuade Stryker to walk until his feet bleed.
0073_00.05.01.690-00.05.05.080	Kayla was injured earlier, however, and succumbs to her wounds and dies.
0073_00.05.05.080-00.05.09.040	Logan regains his consciousness, but has lost all of his memories.
0073_00.05.09.040-00.05.14.390	He sees Kayla's body, but does not recognize her, and leaves the island as the film ends.

0073_00.05.21.415-00.05.25.475	who he in fact was involved with the killing of.

0074_00.00.36.440-00.00.40.400	with a brainwashed, teleporting mutant, named Nightcrawler, 
0074_00.00.40.400-00.00.41.820	 trying to assassinate the President.

0074_00.00.43.820-00.00.46.530	 leaving a note saying, "Mutant Freedom Now."

0074_00.01.15.955-00.01.16.855	Pyro, 
0074_00.01.16.855-00.01.20.685	are able to escape through hidden tunnels.

0074_00.01.50.485-00.01.54.005	As thay are flying away, they are attacked by fighter jets, 
0074_00.01.54.005-00.01.55.660	but Magneto prevents their plane from crashing.
0074_00.01.55.660-00.02.00.240	The X-Men team up with Magneto and Mystique to take down Stryker.
0074_00.02.00.245-00.02.05.435	Magneto reveals to them that the attack on the President at the beginning of the film was a false flag attack, 
0074_00.02.05.435-00.02.08.415	orchestrated by Stryker,
0074_00.02.08.415-00.02.14.245	to justify raiding Xavier's school in order to steal the parts from Cerebro to build a second one at Stryker's secret base.
0074_00.02.14.245-00.02.19.245	At the base, it is revealed that even though Stryker seems to hate mutants,
0074_00.02.19.245-00.02.24.540	he in fact has a mutant son with the ability to create hallucinations and trick people into doing his bidding.

0074_00.02.53.485-00.02.56.955	remembering that he was injected by Stryker with his metal skeleton
0074_00.02.56.955-00.03.02.165	and it was only through his healing abilities that he was able to survive the incredibly painful process.
0074_00.03.02.170-00.03.08.395	This whole backstory is discussed much further in the Wolverine film, which I will be doing a spoiler for at some point.

0074_00.03.40.415-00.03.43.620	and Mystique, Magneto and Pyro escape.
0074_00.03.43.620-00.03.48.280	Nightcrawler and Storm are able, however, to stop Stryker's son
0074_00.03.48.280-00.03.50.830	and free Xavier, preventing the humans from being killed.

0074_00.04.08.945-00.04.11.665	as the water overtakes her, presumably killing her.

0075_00.00.19.465-00.00.23.675	The film follows Derek Zoolander, a dimwitted male model, 
0075_00.00.23.675-00.00.27.060	famous for his various looks, like Blue Steel and Le Tigre, which pretty much look the exact same.
0075_00.00.27.060-00.00.28.510	UNMATCHED
0075_00.00.28.510-00.00.31.290	Derek, however, has fallen from the top of the male fashion world
0075_00.00.31.290-00.00.35.150	to be replaced by a new star, Hansel.

0075_00.00.42.235-00.00.48.675	After losing his roommates in a gasoline explosion, which they happened to cause themselves,

0075_00.00.51.985-00.00.55.120	however, they reject Derek.
0075_00.00.55.120-00.00.57.850	A fashion mogul named Mugatu
0075_00.00.57.850-00.01.05.990	and Derek's agent Maury become involved in a secret plot by the top tier of the fashion industry, 
0075_00.01.05.990-00.01.07.990	in order to find a model who can be brainwashed into assissinating the prime minister of Malaysia, 
0075_00.01.07.990-00.01.12.400	which would allow the fashion industry to continue using cheap child labor in Malaysia.
0075_00.01.12.400-00.01.15.170	Mugatu hires Derek for his next runway show
0075_00.01.15.170-00.01.18.740	and has him sent to a day spa,
0075_00.01.18.740-00.01.22.780	in order to prepare Derek to be brainwashed to kill the Malaysian Prime MInister.
0075_00.01.22.780-00.01.27.580	The journalist, Matilda, who feels partially responsible for Derek's retirement, becomes suspicious of Mugatu's offer to hire Derek
0075_00.01.27.580-00.01.34.480	and is tipped off by an anonymous caller that something is up.
0075_00.01.34.485-00.01.35.895	She tries to warn Derek,
0075_00.01.35.895-00.01.37.295	but Derek ignores her.

0075_00.01.40.065-00.01.43.000	where Derek is challenged by the new star, Hansel.

0075_00.01.51.640-00.01.54.540	who turns out to be former hand model, J.P. Prewett.
0075_00.01.54.540-00.01.59.880	J.P. explains that the fashion industry has all throughout history, been involved in political assassinations
0075_00.01.59.880-00.02.02.220	using brain washed models to kill the targets.
0075_00.02.02.220-00.02.07.320	Mugatu's henchmen attacks the meeting, however,

0082_00.01.32.910-00.01.33.300	UNMATCHED: tipped off by the suspicious Samson,
0082_00.01.33.300-00.01.37.160	causing him to again transform  into the Hulk.
0082_00.01.37.160-00.01.37.510	UNMATCHED: The ensuing battle outside the university proves to be futile for Ross's forces and they eventually retreat,
0082_00.01.37.510-00.01.41.950	though Blonsky, whose sanity is starting to falter, boldly attacks
0082_00.01.41.950-00.01.44.150	and mocks the Hulk.
0082_00.01.44.160-00.01.48.290	The Hulk seemingly kills Blonsky
0082_00.01.48.290-00.01.49.760	and flees with Betty.
0082_00.01.49.760-00.01.52.160	After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run
0082_00.01.52.160-00.01.54.280	and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City.
0082_00.01.54.280-00.01.59.160	Mr. Blue is actually cellular biologist Dr. Samuel Sterns,
0082_00.01.59.160-00.02.01.630	who tells Banner he has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition.
0082_00.02.01.640-00.02.07.420	After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation.
0082_00.02.07.420-00.02.15.210	Sterns reveals he has synthesized Banner's blood samples,
0082_00.02.15.210-00.02.15.490	UNMATCHED: which Banner sent from Brazil,
0082_00.02.15.490-00.02.15.920	UNMATCHED: into a large supply with the intention of applying its limitless potential to medicine.
0082_00.02.15.920-00.02.20.510	UNMATCHED: Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply.
0082_00.02.20.510-00.02.22.710	Meanwhile, Blonsky is revealed to have survived the battle
0082_00.02.22.710-00.02.23.070	and has completely healed.
0082_00.02.23.070-00.02.27.560	He joins Ross's forces for a third attempt to take Banner into custody.
0082_00.02.27.560-00.02.29.170	They succeed,
0082_00.02.29.170-00.02.29.860	and Banner
0082_00.02.29.860-00.02.30.420	along with Betty
0082_00.02.30.420-00.02.31.070	are taken away in a helicopter.
0082_00.02.31.070-00.02.32.540	Blonsky stays behind and forces 
0082_00.02.32.540-00.02.33.490	Sterns
0082_00.02.33.490-00.02.37.750	to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power.
0082_00.02.37.750-00.02.40.760	Stern warns the combination of the super-soldier formula and Banner's blood may cause him to become an "abomination",
0082_00.02.40.770-00.02.44.160	but Blonsky insists.
0082_00.02.44.160-00.02.49.190	The experiment mutates Blonsky into a creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk, but drives him mad.
0082_00.02.49.190-00.02.50.820	He attacks Sterns,
0082_00.02.50.820-00.02.54.150	who gets some of Banner's blood in the cut on his forehead,
0082_00.02.54.150-00.02.55.690	causing him to begin mutating as well.
0082_00.02.55.690-00.02.59.180	Blonsky then rampages through Harlem.
0082_00.02.59.180-00.03.01.000	Realizing the Hulk is the only one who can stop Blonsky,
0082_00.03.01.000-00.03.01.950	Banner convinces Ross to release him.
0082_00.03.01.950-00.03.03.400	He jumps from Ross's helicopter
0082_00.03.03.400-00.03.05.320	and transforms after hitting the ground.
0082_00.03.10.709-00.03.13.780	After a long and brutal battle through Harlem,
0082_00.03.13.780-00.03.15.250	the Hulk defeats Blonsky.
0082_00.03.15.250-00.03.17.760	After having a small, peaceful moment with Betty,
0082_00.03.17.760-00.03.19.760	the Hulk flees from New York.
0082_00.03.19.760-00.03.21.120	A month later, Banner is in Bella Coola, British Columbia.
0082_00.03.21.130-00.03.25.140	Instead of trying to suppress his transformation, 
0082_00.03.25.140-00.03.26.330	he successfully transforms in a controlled manner.
0082_00.03.26.330-00.03.33.030	In a final scene, Tony Stark approaches Ross at a local bar
0082_00.03.33.030-00.03.42.240	and informs him a team, "the Avengers", is being put together.
0083_00.00.00.020-00.00.03.760	In 965 A.D., Odin, King of Asgard,
0083_00.00.03.760-00.00.06.660	wages war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim
0083_00.00.06.660-00.00.08.260	and their leader, Laufey,
0083_00.00.08.260-00.00.09.825	to prevent them from conquering the nine realms, starting with Earth.
0083_00.00.09.825-00.00.12.785	The Asgardian warriors defeat the Frost Giants 
0083_00.00.12.785-00.00.16.365	and seize the source of their power, the casket of ancient winters.
0083_00.00.16.370-00.00.21.270	In the present, Odin's son, Thor, prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard,
0083_00.00.21.270-00.00.23.760	but is interrupted when Frost Giants attempt to retrieve the casket.
0083_00.00.23.765-00.00.28.165	Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, 
0083_00.00.28.165-00.00.28.995	accompanied by his brother, Loki, 
0083_00.00.28.995-00.00.30.425	childhood friend, Sif,
0083_00.00.30.425-00.00.31.515	and the Warriors Three:
0083_00.00.31.515-00.00.32.265	Volstagg,
0083_00.00.32.265-00.00.32.965	Fandral 
0083_00.00.32.965-00.00.33.855	and Hogun.
0083_00.00.33.855-00.00.34.905	A battle ensues
0083_00.00.34.905-00.00.39.745	until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races.
0083_00.00.39.745-00.00.45.905	For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal,
0083_00.00.45.905-00.00.50.425	accompanied by his hammer, Mjolnir, now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.
0083_00.00.50.425-00.00.52.765	Thor lands in New Mexico,
0083_00.00.52.765-00.00.54.395	where astrophysicist, Dr. Jane Foster,
0083_00.00.54.395-00.00.56.195	her assistant, Darcy Lewis,
0083_00.00.56.195-00.00.58.265	and mentor, Dr. Erik Selvig, find him.
0083_00.00.58.265-00.01.01.155	The local populace finds Mjolnir, 
0083_00.01.01.155-00.01.07.635	which Shield agent, Phil Coulson, soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Jane's data about the wormhole that delivered Thor to Earth.
0083_00.01.07.640-00.01.10.160	Thor, having discovered Mjolnir's nearby location, 
0083_00.01.10.160-00.01.14.080	seeks to retrieve it from the facility that Shield quickly constructed,
0083_00.01.14.080-00.01.15.610	but he finds himself unable to lift it
0083_00.01.15.610-00.01.16.490	and is captured.
0083_00.01.16.490-00.01.19.960	With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth
0083_00.01.19.960-00.01.21.530	as he develops a romance with Jane.
0083_00.01.21.530-00.01.24.260	Loki discovers that he is actually Laufey's son,
0083_00.01.24.260-00.01.26.790	adopted by Odin after the war ended.
0083_00.01.26.790-00.01.29.590	A weary Odin falls into the deep Odinsleep to recover his strength.
0083_00.01.29.590-00.01.31.660	Loki seizes the throne in Odin's stead
0083_00.01.31.660-00.01.35.130	and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the casket.
0083_00.01.35.130-00.01.38.860	Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile,
0083_00.01.38.860-00.01.46.290	convincing Heimdall, gatekeeper of the Bifrost, the means of traveling between worlds, to allow them passage to Earth.
0083_00.01.46.295-00.01.47.215	Aware of their plan, 
0083_00.01.47.215-00.01.52.255	Loki sends The Destroyer, a seemingly indestructible automaton to pursue them and kill Thor.
0083_00.01.52.255-00.01.55.575	The warriors find Thor, but The Destroyer attacks and defeats them,
0083_00.01.55.575-00.01.56.795	prompting Thor to offer himself instead.
0083_00.01.56.800-00.01.59.860	Struck by The Destroyer and near death, 
0083_00.01.59.860-00.02.02.790	Thor's sacrifice proves him worthy to wield Mjolnir.
0083_00.02.02.800-00.02.07.040	The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat The Destroyer.
0083_00.02.07.040-00.02.09.760	Kissing Jane goodbye and vowing to return, 
0083_00.02.09.760-00.02.12.350	he and his fellow Asgardians leave to confront Loki.
0083_00.02.12.350-00.02.14.460	Loki betrays and kills Laufey,
0083_00.02.14.460-00.02.18.960	revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life
0083_00.02.18.960-00.02.22.990	as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifrost bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father.
0083_00.02.22.990-00.02.26.990	Thor arrives and fights Loki
0083_00.02.26.990-00.02.29.690	before destroying the Bifrost bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard.
0083_00.02.29.690-00.02.31.060	Odin awakens
0083_00.02.31.060-00.02.35.560	and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, 
0083_00.02.35.560-00.02.39.790	but Loki allows himself to fall when Odin rejects his plays for approval.
0083_00.02.39.790-00.02.44.260	Thor makes amends with Odin and admitting he is not ready to be king,
0083_00.02.44.260-00.02.46.665	while on Earth, Jane and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.
0083_00.02.46.665-00.02.48.325	In a post-credits scene, Selvig has been taken to a Shield facility,
0083_00.02.48.325-00.02.57.220	where Nick Fury opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube shaped object, which Fury says may hold untold power.
0083_00.02.57.220-00.03.01.270	An invisible Loki prompts Selvig to agree and he does.
0084_00.00.04.030-00.00.07.030	This is crazy billionaire John Hammond.
0084_00.00.07.030-00.00.08.500	He's managed to take prehistoric DNA from mosquitoes,
0084_00.00.08.500-00.00.10.300	mix it with frog juice,
0084_00.00.10.310-00.00.12.950	and create a theme park full of dinosaurs.
0084_00.00.12.950-00.00.14.630	However, while building the park there have been some accidents,
0084_00.00.14.630-00.00.15.750	like this guy getting eaten.
0084_00.00.15.750-00.00.17.460	Goodbye, "this guy".
0084_00.00.17.460-00.00.17.910	UNMATCHED: So his lawyer insisted 
0084_00.00.17.910-00.00.21.790	he bring some experts to the park to prove it's safe before being open to the public.
0084_00.00.21.790-00.00.29.400	He gathers Ian Malcolm in black, a chaotician; Ellie Sattler in pink, a paleobotanist; and Dr. Alan Grant in blue, the best paleontologist around.
0084_00.00.29.400-00.00.31.690	Plus that's his lawyer with the hairy knees, Gennaro.
0084_00.00.31.700-00.00.34.680	So they arrive at the park and Dr. Wu tells them what is going on.
0084_00.00.34.680-00.00.36.610	Ian Malcolm cannot get his head around all this.
0084_00.00.36.610-00.00.38.400	He's like, "You can't control these animals.
0084_00.00.38.400-00.00.41.300	Life... ah, ah... finds a way."
0084_00.00.41.300-00.00.41.990	Meanwhile Grant's busy staring at this baby dinosaur
0084_00.00.41.990-00.00.45.920	and he's like, "What species is this?" 
0084_00.00.45.920-00.00.47.750	And Wu's like, "It's a Raptor".
0084_00.00.47.750-00.00.50.110	And Grant's like, "You bred Raptors?"
0084_00.00.50.110-00.00.53.150	And Wu's like, "Yeah.  Yeah, we did."
0084_00.00.53.150-00.00.55.700	Surprise -- here come Hammond's grandkids, Lex and Tim.
0084_00.00.55.700-00.00.58.120	They're coming along to make sure the park is fun for kids.
0084_00.00.58.120-00.01.03.750	And Grant's just looking on in horror and he's like, "I hate kids.  I fucking hate kids."
0084_00.01.03.750-00.01.06.070	So they jump in these awesome self-driving Land Cruisers
0084_00.01.06.070-00.01.06.870	and head out to the park.
0084_00.01.06.870-00.01.08.630	In the control room, watching on, we've got Hammond,
0084_00.01.08.630-00.01.10.190	Mr. Arnold, Muldoon
0084_00.01.10.200-00.01.11.980	and Nedry.
0084_00.01.11.980-00.01.16.390	And get this: Nedry's got this secret plan to steal some embryos for a rival firm, and he's just waiting for the right time to strike.
0084_00.01.16.390-00.01.17.150	Back at the car, the guys see a sick Triceratops
0084_00.01.17.150-00.01.18.220	and just jump out
0084_00.01.18.220-00.01.20.220	and have a look.
0084_00.01.20.220-00.01.24.140	And the guys in the control room are obviously not happy, because the guests are now taking the complete piss.
0084_00.01.24.140-00.01.28.390	So they're like, "Fuck it.  Okay, there's a storm coming anyway.  Get them back here and we'll try again tomorrow."
0084_00.01.28.390-00.01.29.470	This is when Nedry makes his move.
0084_00.01.29.470-00.01.31.530	He turns off the security systems,
0084_00.01.31.530-00.01.32.500	steals the embryos,
0084_00.01.32.500-00.01.33.180	and heads out for the dock.
0084_00.01.33.180-00.01.34.960	On the way, he accidentally bumps into 
0084_00.01.34.960-00.01.35.870	a Dilophosaurus,
0084_00.01.35.870-00.01.37.550	gets green shit spat in his face,
0084_00.01.37.550-00.01.38.570	and dies.
0084_00.01.38.570-00.01.39.200	So now all hell is going to break loose.
0084_00.01.39.200-00.01.40.150	The fences are out.
0084_00.01.40.150-00.01.43.220	The cars have come to a stop outside the T-rex enclosure.
0084_00.01.43.220-00.01.44.910	Tim's like, "Do you feel that?"
0084_00.01.44.910-00.01.46.360	The water starts rippling.
0084_00.01.46.360-00.01.47.470	The T-rex approaches.
0084_00.01.47.470-00.01.48.780	The lawyer shits it,
0084_00.01.48.780-00.01.50.620	and runs away to the toilet and hides.
0084_00.01.50.620-00.01.53.200	T-rex breaks through the fences -- best scene of the movie.
0084_00.01.53.210-00.02.00.070	Now this is when Grant's hatred of kids is vindicated, because they just make a couple of really, really bad decisions.
0084_00.02.00.070-00.02.01.420	Lex starts shining a torch directly at the T-rex,
0084_00.02.01.420-00.02.02.350	and then Tim slams the door
0084_00.02.02.350-00.02.04.270	in its face.
0084_00.02.04.270-00.02.04.980	So Rex fucks up the car completely
0084_00.02.04.980-00.02.06.790	and tips it on its roof.
0084_00.02.06.790-00.02.08.420	This is Grant's hero moment.
0084_00.02.08.420-00.02.11.710	He lights a flare, gets out of the car, and throws it aside.
0084_00.02.11.710-00.02.14.090	But he stays still because he knows T-rex's vision is based on movement.
0084_00.02.14.090-00.02.16.010	Then Malcolm gets out to try and help as well.
0084_00.02.16.010-00.02.18.750	Grant's like, "Ian, freeze!"
0084_00.02.18.750-00.02.22.210	But Malcolm, for some reason, just starts running and he's like, "Get the kids!"
0084_00.02.22.210-00.02.23.470	T-rex chases him,
0084_00.02.23.470-00.02.24.510	sends him flying, and smashes into the toilet,
0084_00.02.24.520-00.02.25.790	where he finds the lawyer,
0084_00.02.25.790-00.02.27.630	and he just eats him to death.
0084_00.02.27.630-00.02.28.600	Grant tries to help the kids,
0084_00.02.28.600-00.02.30.350	but T-rex is like, "Fuck this noise"
0084_00.02.30.350-00.02.31.460	and just barges them over the cliff.
0084_00.02.31.470-00.02.34.210	Ellie and Muldoon come out to try and find them,
0084_00.02.34.210-00.02.34.690	UNMATCHED: but they're already gone and lost in the park by now.
0084_00.02.34.700-00.02.35.830	They pick up Malcolm
0084_00.02.35.830-00.02.36.950	and are chased away by the T-rex.
0084_00.02.36.950-00.02.39.690	Grant's [unintelligible] look after these kids with this crazy situation,
0084_00.02.39.690-00.02.42.950	and they find some eggs,
0084_00.02.42.950-00.02.45.910	and Grant works out that this must mean that the dinosaurs can actually breed, despite Wu earlier on telling them that they're all female.
0084_00.02.45.910-00.02.48.450	UNMATCHED: Something to do with frog DNA, meaning you can change sex.
0084_00.02.48.450-00.02.50.190	Anyway, "life found a way".
0084_00.02.50.190-00.02.51.440	So Goldblum's got his chest out
0084_00.02.51.440-00.02.53.690	and Mr. Arnold went to try and reboot the system, but disappeared.
0084_00.02.53.700-00.02.56.070	Muldoon and Ellie then go and try and find him,
0084_00.02.56.070-00.02.58.300	but Muldoon's like, "Ah, shit.  We're being hunted, mate.
0084_00.02.58.300-00.02.59.080	You go ahead
0084_00.02.59.080-00.02.59.830	and I'll sort these out."
0084_00.02.59.830-00.03.01.310	He aims for one Raptor,
0084_00.03.01.310-00.03.03.060	but then the other one comes and kills him from the side.
0084_00.03.03.060-00.03.04.620	"Clever girl."
0084_00.03.04.620-00.03.05.950	Ellie manages to find the control panel
0084_00.03.05.950-00.03.07.190	and turns everything back on,
0084_00.03.07.190-00.03.08.550	but gets attacked by a Raptor in the process.
0084_00.03.08.550-00.03.11.650	She bumps into Mr. Arnold's severed arm and she's just like, "For God's sake,"
0084_00.03.11.650-00.03.13.190	and gets the hell out of there.
0084_00.03.13.190-00.03.15.200	Meanwhile, Grant just drops the kids back up at the Visitor's Center.
0084_00.03.15.200-00.03.15.960	They'll be fine.
0084_00.03.15.960-00.03.16.970	Raptors show up.
0084_00.03.16.970-00.03.18.310	The kids have to hide in the kitchen.
0084_00.03.18.310-00.03.19.160	It's super tense,
0084_00.03.19.160-00.03.20.830	but somehow they manage to lock one in a fridge
0084_00.03.20.830-00.03.22.190	and get out to find Grant and Ellie.
0084_00.03.22.190-00.03.25.900	Lex manages to turn the security systems back on,
0084_00.03.25.900-00.03.26.300	UNMATCHED: meaning that Hammond can call the mainland for a chopper.
0084_00.03.26.300-00.03.31.190	The group then find themselves in the lobby of the Visitor's Center, surrounded by Raptors and certain death until -- da-da-da -- 
0084_00.03.31.190-00.03.33.150	T-rex comes back and eats the Raptors,
0084_00.03.33.150-00.03.34.700	leaving the humans free to sneak out.
0084_00.03.34.710-00.03.36.900	Raptors dead, T-Rex roars, amazing.
0084_00.03.36.900-00.03.39.710	The guys then run outside and hop into a jeep with Hammond and Malcolm.
0084_00.03.39.710-00.03.44.790	Grant's like, "Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your park!" and Hammond's like, "Yeah, no shit."
0084_00.03.44.790-00.03.46.020	They get back to the helipad
0084_00.03.46.020-00.03.46.710	and take off.
0084_00.03.46.710-00.03.49.090	Credits roll.
0085_00.00.28.580-00.00.31.890	The film begins in Los Angeles in 2019,
0085_00.00.31.890-00.00.38.040	where ex-cop Rick Deckard is being detained by Officer Gaff
0085_00.00.38.040-00.00.39.450	and is brought before his former supervisor, Harry Bryant.
0085_00.00.39.455-00.00.42.455	Deckard used to work as a Blade Runner, 
0085_00.00.42.455-00.00.47.700	which involved tracking down biologically engineered beings, known as replicants, and would retire, aka kill the robots.
0085_00.00.47.700-00.00.51.040	Deckard is asked to come back to the job
0085_00.00.51.040-00.00.58.200	to track down four replicants that have came to Earth illegally in order to extend their lifespans, which is supposed to be just for four years.
0085_00.00.58.200-00.01.10.280	Deckard watches a video of another Blade Runner giving a replicant a Voight-Kampff test, which is used to determine if the subject is a human or a replicant based off their emotional responses.
0085_00.01.10.280-00.01.13.830	The subject, Leon, shoots and kills the Blade Runner after being asked about his mother.
0085_00.01.13.830-00.01.15.160	Leon,
0085_00.01.15.160-00.01.16.650	along with three other replicants,
0085_00.01.16.650-00.01.17.950	Roy Batty,
0085_00.01.17.950-00.01.18.740	Zhora 
0085_00.01.18.740-00.01.22.290	and Pris are targets Deckard is asked to retire.
0085_00.01.22.300-00.01.24.915	Deckard eventually agrees to pursue the replicants.
0085_00.01.24.915-00.01.28.115	Deckard begins investigating the Tyrell corporation, 
0085_00.01.28.115-00.01.33.205	the company that made the Nexus 6 models, the version of the replicants that his targets are.
0085_00.01.33.205-00.01.35.665	He wants to know if they test will work on the newer models, 
0085_00.01.35.665-00.01.39.785	and meets Dr. Eldon Tyrell, the initial creator of the replicants, 
0085_00.01.39.785-00.01.44.500	and his assistant, Rachael, an experimental replicant who believes she's actually human.
0085_00.01.44.500-00.01.50.380	She has been given false memories for a more real emotional response, making testing very difficult.
0085_00.01.50.380-00.01.52.540	While Deckard is pursuing the replicants, 
0085_00.01.52.540-00.01.56.940	the replicants are searching for Dr. Tyrell in order to extend their lifespans.
0085_00.01.56.945-00.02.01.315	Roy and Leon investigate a replicant manufacturing lab
0085_00.02.01.315-00.02.06.160	and learn of a genetic designer, J.F. Sebastian, who works with Dr. Tyrell.
0085_00.02.06.160-00.02.10.740	Eventually, Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him into siding with her.
0085_00.02.10.740-00.02.15.240	Meanwhile, Rachael visits with Deckard at his apartment to prove that she is human
0085_00.02.15.240-00.02.17.120	by showing him a family photo,
0085_00.02.17.120-00.02.21.660	but Deckard explains that her memories are false, taken from Dr. Tyrell's niece, 
0085_00.02.21.660-00.02.23.700	and she leaves in tears.
0085_00.02.23.700-00.02.28.830	While searching Leon's apartment, Deckard finds a photo of Zhora and a synthetic snake scale
0085_00.02.28.830-00.02.31.035	and leads him to the strip club where Zhora works.
0085_00.02.31.035-00.02.32.855	Deckard kills Zhora
0085_00.02.32.855-00.02.35.415	and shortly after is told by Bryant that he needs to retire Rachael,
0085_00.02.35.415-00.02.38.370	as she has escaped from the Tyrell corporation.
0085_00.02.38.370-00.02.40.370	Deckard spots Rachael,
0085_00.02.40.370-00.02.42.290	but is attacked by Leon 
0085_00.02.42.290-00.02.44.950	and eventually Rachael kills Leon using Deckard's gun.
0085_00.02.44.950-00.02.49.070	The two go back to Deckard's apartment and Deckard promises not to track her down.
0085_00.02.49.070-00.02.50.740	At Sebastian's apartment, 
0085_00.02.50.740-00.02.53.490	Roy tells Pris that the other replicants are dead.
0085_00.02.53.500-00.03.01.330	Sebastian decides to continue to help them as he has an aging disorder, which causes him to die at a much faster rate, much like the replicants.
0085_00.03.01.330-00.03.04.160	Sebastian and Roy enter Dr. Tyrell's penthouse
0085_00.03.04.160-00.03.07.950	and Roy demands for Dr. Tyrell to extend his life.
0085_00.03.07.955-00.03.10.735	Tyrell tells Roy that it's impossible to extend his life
0085_00.03.10.735-00.03.12.700	and eventually Roy kills him.
0085_00.03.12.700-00.03.16.990	Sebastian and Roy take an elevator down together 
0085_00.03.16.990-00.03.19.040	and though not shown, it is implied that Roy kills Sebastian.
0085_00.03.19.040-00.03.20.580	Back at Sebastian's apartment,
0085_00.03.20.580-00.03.22.700	Deckard is ambushed by Pris,
0085_00.03.22.700-00.03.25.540	but he manages to kill her as Roy returns.
0085_00.03.25.545-00.03.29.495	Roy begins to die from reaching the end of his lifespan
0085_00.03.29.505-00.03.30.990	and begins to chase Deckard, ending up on the roof.
0085_00.03.30.990-00.03.34.150	Deckard tries to jump to another roof, but misses and is left hanging.
0085_00.03.34.150-00.03.36.240	Roy easily makes the jump
0085_00.03.36.240-00.03.37.350	and pulls Deckard up.
0085_00.03.37.350-00.03.43.360	As Roy's time runs out, he says that his memories will be lost in time, like tears in the rain.
0085_00.03.43.365-00.03.46.705	Officer Gaff arrives and shouts to Deckard about Rachael,
0085_00.03.46.705-00.03.50.565	saying it's too bad she won't live, but then again who does.
0085_00.03.50.565-00.03.52.665	Deckard returns to his apartment, 
0085_00.03.52.665-00.03.54.410	finding Rachael safe in his bed.
0085_00.03.54.410-00.04.01.115	Deckard finds a small tinfoil origami unicorn on the floor from Gaff and recalls Gaff's final words.
0085_00.04.01.115-00.04.04.615	The unicorn refers to a dream that Deckard had earlier in the film,
0085_00.04.04.615-00.04.09.640	 implying that Officer Gaff knew what Deckard was dreaming about because Deckard himself was in fact a replicant.
0085_00.04.09.640-00.04.11.180	UNMATCHED
0085_00.04.11.180-00.04.14.650	Deckard and Rachael quickly leave the apartment as the film ends.

0086_00.00.48.925-00.00.52.175	however, he continually charms Brad into letting him stay.
0086_00.00.52.175-00.00.54.855	After multiple instances of Dusty showing Brad up,
0086_00.00.54.855-00.00.58.605	Brad realizes what Dusty's motives are.
0086_00.00.58.605-00.00.59.325	The two men seem to reach an understanding

0086_00.01.07.770-00.01.12.175	Brad is stunned when Dusty reveals that he still intends to drive Brad out of the family.

0086_00.01.17.445-00.01.20.065	including seats to a basketball game.

0086_00.01.28.930-00.01.30.290	This leads Brad to moving out of the house,
0086_00.01.30.290-00.01.32.260	 forcing Dusty to step up as a Dad.

0087_00.02.08.745-00.02.10.625	and are able to steal the locket back from Umbridge.
0087_00.02.10.630-00.02.16.050	They hide out in the woods and try to destroy the Horcrux, but have a lot of difficulty.
0087_00.02.16.050-00.02.20.700	The locket curses whoever wears it to become angry, depressed and paranoid,
0087_00.02.20.700-00.02.23.130	UNMATCHED:  almost like the ring from Lord of the Ring, 
0087_00.02.23.130-00.02.24.540	so they try to take turns wearing the locket.
0087_00.02.24.540-00.02.28.190	Ron becomes particularly upset after wearing the locket
0087_00.02.28.190-00.02.29.200	UNMATCHED:  and leaves Hermione and Harry.
0087_00.02.29.205-00.02.33.035	Hermione decides that because it is coded in basilisk blood,
0087_00.02.33.035-00.02.37.535	the sword of Godric Griffindor would be able to destroy the Horcrux, 
0087_00.02.37.535-00.02.39.530	which is why Dumbledore wanted them to have it.
0087_00.02.39.530-00.02.41.990	They then travel to the house where Harry's parents died
0087_00.02.41.990-00.02.44.680	and encounter a woman that they believe has the sword.
0087_00.02.44.680-00.02.46.480	However, this is a trap
0087_00.02.46.480-00.02.52.950	and it is actually Voldemort''s pet snake, Nagini, in disguise, who attacks them and they flee.
0087_00.02.52.950-00.02.55.070	Harry is also continually having visions of Voldemort,
0087_00.02.55.070-00.03.03.820	who is interrogating a wand-maker named Grigorovich, who claims to have had a mystical wand that was stolen by a young teenage boy, 
0087_00.03.03.820-00.03.05.740	who was actually the infamous wizard, Gilbert Grindelwald,
0087_00.03.05.740-00.03.09.330	 the same wizard seen at the Fantastic Beasts film.
0087_00.03.09.330-00.03.15.450	Voldemort eventually interrogates Grindelwald about the wand's location and then he is killed by Voldemort.
0087_00.03.15.450-00.03.18.540	Harry is led by a Patronus of a doe, 
0087_00.03.18.540-00.03.19.910	which leads him to the sword of Griffindor,
0087_00.03.19.910-00.03.22.030	to be found under a frozen pond.
0087_00.03.22.035-00.03.27.045	Harry tries to jump in and get it, but the locket that he is wearing tries to strangle him,
0087_00.03.27.045-00.03.28.245	but he is saved by Ron.
0087_00.03.28.245-00.03.31.285	Harry uses his Parseltongue ability, or snake talking, to open the locket, 
0087_00.03.31.285-00.03.34.995	revealing tormenting images,
0087_00.03.34.995-00.03.37.375	but Ron is able to destroy the locket.
0087_00.03.37.375-00.03.39.205	Hermione and Ron reconcile
0087_00.03.39.205-00.03.41.745	and they travel to see Xenophilius Lovegood, 
0087_00.03.41.745-00.03.43.535	the father of Luna Lovegood, 
0087_00.03.43.535-00.03.46.620	to understand the symbol hidden in the book given by Dumbledore.
0087_00.03.46.620-00.03.55.290	Lovegood tells the story of the Deathly Hallows, a story of three brothers given powerful magical items, which when combined, would make one the Master of Death.
0087_00.03.55.295-00.03.58.205	The three items include the invisibility cloak,
0087_00.03.58.205-00.04.00.615	a stone that would bring back dead loved ones
0087_00.04.00.615-00.04.04.125	and an all-powerful wand called the Elder Wand.
0087_00.04.04.125-00.04.06.765	Death Eaters arrive, however, and the group flees,
0087_00.04.06.765-00.04.10.915	but a group of Death Eaters and Snatchers eventually find them.
0087_00.04.10.920-00.04.14.830	Hermione uses a spell to disguise Harry's features before they are captured
0087_00.04.14.830-00.04.17.110	and they are brought to the Malfoy Manor.
0087_00.04.17.115-00.04.20.615	Bellatrix Lestrange locks up Harry and Ron,
0087_00.04.20.615-00.04.22.825	along with Luna, the wand-maker, Ollivander
0087_00.04.22.825-00.04.24.705	and a goblin named Griphook.
0087_00.04.24.705-00.04.29.285	Bellatrix tortures Hermione, trying to find out how they got the sword of Griffindor,
0087_00.04.29.285-00.04.32.650	because she had the sword locked in her vault in Gringotts.
0087_00.04.32.650-00.04.34.940	Harry is able to contact help
0087_00.04.34.940-00.04.37.360	and Dobby appears to save them
0087_00.04.37.360-00.04.38.650	and a battle ensues.
0087_00.04.38.670-00.04.41.120	Harry disarms Draco
0087_00.04.41.120-00.04.44.450	and they all disapparate right as Bellatrix throws a knife.
0087_00.04.44.450-00.04.45.950	They arrive at a beach
0087_00.04.45.950-00.04.48.370	 to find out that Dobby has been killed by the blade.
0087_00.04.48.370-00.04.53.330	In the final scene of the film, we see that Voldemort has discovered the Elder Wand's location and opens Dumbledore's tomb
0087_00.04.53.330-00.04.58.330	to claim the powerful wand for himself.
0088_00.00.28.000-00.00.29.530	After burying Dobby,
0088_00.00.29.530-00.00.32.200	the trio decide, with the help of the goblin, Griphook,
0088_00.00.32.200-00.00.38.040	 to break into Bellatrix Lestragne's vault in Gringotts Bank, suspecting that another Horcrux is there.
0088_00.00.38.045-00.00.41.285	Griphook agrees to help them,
0088_00.00.41.285-00.00.42.695	 in exchange for the Sword of Gryffindor.
0088_00.00.42.695-00.00.49.065	Wand-maker Ollivander explains to Harry that the wands that they took belong to Bellatrix and Draco Malfoy,
0088_00.00.49.065-00.00.53.360	but because Harry disarmed Malfoy, the wand has now changed its allegiance.
0088_00.00.53.360-00.00.56.200	Once inside the vault,
0088_00.00.56.200-00.00.57.580	they find the Horcrux is Hufflepuff's cup.
0088_00.00.57.585-00.00.58.745	They retrieve it
0088_00.00.58.745-00.01.00.445	and Griphook takes the sword
0088_00.01.00.445-00.01.03.170	and the vault security is activated, setting off alarms.
0088_00.01.03.170-00.01.08.610	The trio are able to escape on the back of an imprisoned dragon.
0088_00.01.08.610-00.01.14.830	Voldemort finds out about the theft and kills many at the bank, now aware that Harry is pursuing the Horcruxes.
0088_00.01.14.835-00.01.16.855	Harry realizes that there must be another Horcrux
0088_00.01.16.855-00.01.19.540	related to Ravenclaw at Hogwarts.
0088_00.01.19.540-00.01.24.790	They are then able to sneak back into Hogwarts with the help of Dumbledore's brother, Aberforth, 
0088_00.01.24.790-00.01.26.600	and they meet Neville Longbottom, 
0088_00.01.26.600-00.01.28.950	who has gathered a small army of students
0088_00.01.28.950-00.01.31.160	 to fight against the Death Eaters that have taken over the school.
0088_00.01.31.160-00.01.35.720	Snape, the new headmaster, begins to threaten anyone who is trying to help Harry,
0088_00.01.35.720-00.01.40.580	but Harry reveals himself with the help of students, teachers, and the members of the Order of the Phoenix
0088_00.01.40.580-00.01.42.980	and they all begin a battle.
0088_00.01.42.985-00.01.47.205	Harry talks to the ghost of Helena Ravenclaw, 
0088_00.01.47.205-00.01.49.705	who reveals that her mother's diadem was used as a Horcrux
0088_00.01.49.705-00.01.52.335	and it is located in the Room of Requirement.
0088_00.01.52.345-00.01.56.075	Hermione travels with Ron into the Chamber of Secrets
0088_00.01.56.075-00.01.57.995	and recover a Basilisk fang
0088_00.01.57.995-00.01.59.915	to destroy Hufflepuff's cup
0088_00.01.59.915-00.02.02.045	and afterwards they share a kiss.
0088_00.02.02.045-00.02.06.665	In the Room of Requirement, Draco and other Slytherin students attack Harry
0088_00.02.06.665-00.02.08.290	but Ron and Hermione intervene.
0088_00.02.08.290-00.02.13.620	One student casts a powerful fiend fire spell and is burned to death.
0088_00.02.13.625-00.02.14.695	Harry saves Draco
0088_00.02.14.695-00.02.19.635	and destroys the diadem by using a Basilisk fang and throwing it into the fire.
0088_00.02.19.640-00.02.21.450	As Voldemort's army attacks, 
0088_00.02.21.450-00.02.25.330	Harry discovers that the final Horcrux is his pet snake, Nagini.
0088_00.02.25.335-00.02.27.565	They then witness Voldemort talking to Snape,
0088_00.02.27.565-00.02.34.955	telling Snape that the reason the Elder Wand hasn't been working properly for him is because Snape is the one who the wand shows allegience to, 
0088_00.02.34.955-00.02.36.965	so Voldemort has Nagini kill Snape.
0088_00.02.36.965-00.02.37.990	UNMATCHED
0088_00.02.37.990-00.02.41.620	Before Snape dies, however, he gives his memories to Harry.
0088_00.02.41.620-00.02.44.540	During all the fighting at the school, Fred Weasley,
0088_00.02.44.540-00.02.46.700	Lupin and Tonks have all been killed.
0088_00.02.46.705-00.02.48.665	Harry takes Snape's memory
0088_00.02.48.665-00.02.52.995	and uses a pensive to learn more about how James Potter bullied Snape
0088_00.02.52.995-00.02.54.820	and how Snape loved Lily Potter.
0088_00.02.54.820-00.02.59.940	After their deaths, Snape vowed to Dumbledore to do whatever it took to protect Harry
0088_00.02.59.940-00.03.06.490	and that the doe patronus that aided him in the previous film to find the sword was sent by Snape.
0088_00.03.06.495-00.03.11.745	Harry also learns that he, himself is actually the eighth Horcrux
0088_00.03.11.745-00.03.13.575	and must die to make Voldemort more vulnerable, 
0088_00.03.13.575-00.03.15.740	a secret that Dumbledore never revealed to Harry.
0088_00.03.15.745-00.03.20.415	Harry then decides to surrender himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest, 
0088_00.03.20.415-00.03.22.495	where Voldemort casts the killing curse on him.
0088_00.03.22.495-00.03.24.915	Harry enters into limbo,
0088_00.03.24.915-00.03.27.615	where he is met by the spirit of Dumbledore,
0088_00.03.27.615-00.03.30.085	who explains that Voldemort destroyed the part of his soul that was within Harry.
0088_00.03.30.085-00.03.31.915	Harry returns back to his body
0088_00.03.31.915-00.03.34.870	being carried by Hagrid, seemingly dead.
0088_00.03.34.870-00.03.39.160	Voldemort announces that he has killed Harry and demands that everyone surrender.
0088_00.03.39.160-00.03.42.740	Harry then reveals that he is actually alive
0088_00.03.42.740-00.03.44.820	and some of the Death Eaters, including the Malfoys, flee.
0088_00.03.44.825-00.03.47.155	Harry and Voldemort battle through the castle 
0088_00.03.47.155-00.03.50.610	and Neville decapitates Nagini using the Sword of Gryffindor.
0088_00.03.50.610-00.03.55.440	Now that the final Horcrux has been destroyed, Voldemort is now vulnerable.
0088_00.03.55.440-00.03.58.370	Molly Weasley kills Bellatrix Lestrange.
0088_00.03.58.370-00.04.00.540	Harry eventually is able to rebound Voldemort's killing curse,
0088_00.04.00.540-00.04.03.650	obliterating him.
0088_00.04.03.650-00.04.12.240	After the battle, Harry explains that the reason Voldemort couldn't defeat Harry, even though he had the Elder Wand, is because the Elder Wand didn't actually belong to him,
0088_00.04.12.240-00.04.14.650	as Snape wasn't the one who disarmed Dumbledore.
0088_00.04.14.655-00.04.18.785	Draco was the one who disarmed Dumbledore, making the wand Draco's,
0088_00.04.18.785-00.04.20.705	but then Harry disarmed Draco,
0088_00.04.20.705-00.04.22.700	making the Elder Wand Harry's.
0088_00.04.22.700-00.04.26.320	Harry decides, though, to destroy the Elder Wand.
0088_00.04.26.320-00.04.28.040	The film transitions to nineteen years later,
0088_00.04.28.040-00.04.31.190	where we see Ron and Hermione's children going to school,
0088_00.04.31.190-00.04.34.160	along with the children of Harry and Ginny.
0089_00.00.17.630-00.00.20.700	The series does take place during two timelines,
0089_00.00.20.700-00.00.21.860	with the characters being both adults
0089_00.00.21.860-00.00.23.040	and kids,
0089_00.00.23.050-00.00.26.690	their stories being told simultaneously.
0089_00.00.26.690-00.00.29.070	However, for this Spoiler we'll be doing it in a more chronological fashion.
0089_00.00.29.080-00.00.31.160	The series starts in Dreary, Maine, in the year 1960.
0089_00.00.31.160-00.00.34.830	A boy named Bill gives
0089_00.00.34.830-00.00.36.120	his brother Georgie a paper sailboat
0089_00.00.36.120-00.00.38.060	to take out in the rain,
0089_00.00.38.060-00.00.39.500	which eventually falls into a storm drain.
0089_00.00.39.500-00.00.40.870	Georgie tries to retrieve the boat
0089_00.00.40.870-00.00.45.620	when he encounters a clown named Pennywise who is inside the drain.
0089_00.00.45.620-00.00.47.660	As Georgie tries to reach into the drain, 
0089_00.00.47.660-00.00.49.240	his arm is torn off
0089_00.00.49.240-00.00.51.220	and he is killed by Pennywise.
0089_00.00.51.220-00.00.53.860	A few months later, after several more children have gone missing,
0089_00.00.53.860-00.00.56.240	we see several children have come together
0089_00.00.56.240-00.00.58.230	to form the Loser Group,
0089_00.00.58.230-00.00.59.560	who are all tormented
0089_00.00.59.560-00.01.00.990	by a local group of bullies
0089_00.01.00.990-00.01.02.440	led by Henry Bowers.
0089_00.01.02.440-00.01.05.120	The Loser Group consists of Bill, who has a stutter;
0089_00.01.05.120-00.01.06.790	Eddy,
0089_00.01.06.790-00.01.07.610	who has asthma
0089_00.01.07.610-00.01.08.030	UNMATCHED: and an overbearing mother;
0089_00.01.08.030-00.01.09.250	Beverly,
0089_00.01.09.250-00.01.10.540	who has an abusive father;
0089_00.01.10.540-00.01.12.440	Ritchie, who tells too many jokes;
0089_00.01.12.440-00.01.14.740	Stanley, who is a Jewish boy scout;
0089_00.01.14.740-00.01.17.290	Ben, who is an overweight boy
0089_00.01.17.290-00.01.18.150	with a crush on Beverly;
0089_00.01.18.150-00.01.20.700	and Mike, who is a bit of a historian.
0089_00.01.20.700-00.01.22.660	The group realize that they have all seen Pennywise
0089_00.01.22.660-00.01.24.680	in one way or another
0089_00.01.24.680-00.01.26.990	and that their haunts are no coincidence.
0089_00.01.26.990-00.01.28.870	Because it takes on whatever the group fears the most,
0089_00.01.28.870-00.01.32.040	they decide to refer to the monster as "It".
0089_00.01.32.040-00.01.34.700	Mike shows them a scrapbook that he made 
0089_00.01.34.700-00.01.37.540	that shows the It attacks occur every 30 years,
0089_00.01.37.540-00.01.39.530	then It goes into hibernation.
0089_00.01.39.530-00.01.41.750	Bill leads the Loser Group
0089_00.01.41.750-00.01.44.270	into the sewers to hunt down It to avenge his brother.
0089_00.01.44.270-00.01.48.320	They are followed by Henry and his friends, all who plan on killing the Loser Group.
0089_00.01.48.320-00.01.50.450	Pennywise kills one of the bullies,
0089_00.01.50.450-00.01.53.910	and eventually Pennywise grabs Stan,
0089_00.01.53.910-00.01.56.040	but the Losers are able to defeat him through the power of their imagination.
0089_00.01.56.040-00.01.59.080	Using silver earrings as projectiles,
0089_00.01.59.080-00.02.01.130	they pierce a hole in his head
0089_00.02.01.130-00.02.02.070	and Pennywise escapes down a drain,
0089_00.02.02.070-00.02.04.490	seemingly dead.
0089_00.02.04.490-00.02.11.530	Henry is driven insane from seeing Pennywise's deadlights and ends up taking credit for all the missing and murdered children, 
0089_00.02.11.530-00.02.13.650	and Henry is institutionalized.
0089_00.02.13.650-00.02.17.580	The group agrees to come back to Dreary if It ever returns.
0089_00.02.17.580-00.02.20.110	Thirty years later, Mike is now the town librarian
0089_00.02.20.120-00.02.22.530	and is investigating
0089_00.02.22.530-00.02.24.040	a new string of missing and killed children.
0089_00.02.24.040-00.02.25.680	At a scene of one of the murders,
0089_00.02.25.680-00.02.26.110	he finds a picture 
0089_00.02.26.110-00.02.27.660	of Georgie
0089_00.02.27.660-00.02.29.440	and is convinced that It has returned.
0089_00.02.29.440-00.02.37.350	Mike contacts the other members of the Loser Group, all who have left Dreary and become very successful. 
0089_00.02.37.350-00.02.39.040	All of the members have forgotten their encounter with It until they receive Mike's call
0089_00.02.39.040-00.02.41.110	and their memories start to come back.
0089_00.02.41.110-00.02.43.230	Five of the members decide to come back,
0089_00.02.43.230-00.02.44.280	but overtaken by fear,
0089_00.02.44.280-00.02.45.570	Stan kills himself
0089_00.02.45.570-00.02.48.880	and writes "It" on the wall in blood.
0089_00.02.48.880-00.02.51.710	Once they arrive in Dreary, the Losers are again tormented
0089_00.02.51.710-00.02.53.490	by It
0089_00.02.53.490-00.02.55.530	and they learn of Stan's suicide.
0089_00.02.55.530-00.02.56.830	 Bill's wife Audra 
0089_00.02.56.830-00.02.57.950	comes to Dreary to help and find her husband,
0089_00.02.57.950-00.03.01.360	but is eventually captured by It.
0089_00.03.01.360-00.03.02.790	Henry is freed from his institution
0089_00.03.02.790-00.03.04.080	by Pennywise
0089_00.03.04.080-00.03.04.780	so that Henry can kill the Losers.
0089_00.03.04.780-00.03.07.900	Henry injures Mike
0089_00.03.07.900-00.03.10.240	but the Losers end up killing Henry.
0089_00.03.10.240-00.03.12.160	They travel into the sewers,
0089_00.03.12.160-00.03.12.860	and Bill finds
0089_00.03.12.860-00.03.14.040	Audra in a catatonic state
0089_00.03.14.040-00.03.15.310	and the group
0089_00.03.15.310-00.03.16.830	finds It in his true form:
0089_00.03.16.830-00.03.19.160	a giant, spider-like alien.
0089_00.03.19.160-00.03.20.740	Bill, Ben,
0089_00.03.20.740-00.03.21.870	and Ritchie
0089_00.03.21.870-00.03.23.980	nearly get pulled into It's deadlights
0089_00.03.23.980-00.03.24.490	and Eddy
0089_00.03.24.490-00.03.26.940	is killed attempting to save his friends.
0089_00.03.26.940-00.03.29.740	Beverly injures It with her slingshot,
0089_00.03.29.740-00.03.30.660	and It falls,
0089_00.03.30.660-00.03.33.040	and the surviving Losers rip out It's heart,
0089_00.03.33.040-00.03.34.320	killing It.
0089_00.03.34.320-00.03.36.820	The group go their separate ways,
0089_00.03.36.820-00.03.39.160	with Ben and Beverly getting married and are now expecting a child,
0089_00.03.39.160-00.03.42.030	and Audra finally recovers and is with Bill.
0090_00.00.28.235-00.00.32.285	Research scientist Galen Urso and his family
0090_00.00.32.285-00.00.33.705	are hiding on the planet Lah'mu.
0090_00.00.33.705-00.00.38.235	Imperial weapons developer, Orson Krennic, arrives to press him into completing the Death Star, 
0090_00.00.38.235-00.00.40.405	a space station-based super weapon,
0090_00.00.40.405-00.00.43.365	capable of destroying planets.
0090_00.00.43.365-00.00.45.035	Galen's wife Lyra is killed,
0090_00.00.45.035-00.00.46.315	but their daughter, Jyn, escapes
0090_00.00.46.315-00.00.50.585	 and is taken safely by Rebel extremist, Saw Gerrera.
0090_00.00.50.585-00.00.54.615	Fifteen years later, cargo pilot, Bodhi Rook, defects from the Empire, 
0090_00.00.54.615-00.00.57.805	taking a holographic message, recorded by Galen to Gerrera
0090_00.00.57.805-00.01.00.295	on the desert moon, Jedha.
0090_00.01.00.295-00.01.04.855	Rebel intelligence officer Cassian Andor frees Jyn from the Imperial labor camp
0090_00.01.04.855-00.01.08.680	before bringing her to the Rebel leader, Mon Mothma,
0090_00.01.08.685-00.01.12.655	who convinces her to find and rescue Galen, 
0090_00.01.12.655-00.01.14.240	so that the Alliance can learn more about the Death Star.
0090_00.01.14.240-00.01.19.930	However, Cassian is covertly ordered to kill Galen, rather than extract him.
0090_00.01.19.930-00.01.26.700	Jyn, Cassian, and a reprogrammed droid, K-2SO, travel to Jedha,
0090_00.01.26.700-00.01.28.200	where the Empire is removing kyber crystals
0090_00.01.28.200-00.01.29.770	to power the Death Star, 
0090_00.01.29.770-00.01.32.790	and Gerrera and his group are fighting back.
0090_00.01.32.795-00.01.36.415	With the aid of Chirrut Imwe and Baze Malbus,
0090_00.01.36.415-00.01.38.615	Jyn makes contact with Gerrera, 
0090_00.01.38.615-00.01.41.050	who has been holding Rook captive.
0090_00.01.41.055-00.01.42.745	Gerrera shows her the message, 
0090_00.01.42.745-00.01.50.285	in which Galen reveals that he has built an intentional vulnerability in the Death Star and directs them to retrieve the schematics
0090_00.01.50.285-00.01.52.990	from an Imperial data bank on the planet Scarif.
0090_00.01.52.990-00.01.56.870	On the Death Star, Krennic orders a low-powered test shot, 
0090_00.01.56.870-00.01.58.330	which destroys Jedha's capital.
0090_00.01.58.330-00.02.01.450	Jyn and her group take Rook and flee
0090_00.02.01.450-00.02.04.410	but Gerrera remains to die with the city.
0090_00.02.04.415-00.02.07.495	Grand Moff Tarkin congratulates Krennic
0090_00.02.07.495-00.02.09.475	but uses Rook's defection and security leak
0090_00.02.09.475-00.02.13.170	as a pretext to take control of the project.
0090_00.02.13.170-00.02.18.110	Rook leads the group to Galen's Imperial research facility on the planet Eadu,
0090_00.02.18.110-00.02.21.115	where Cassian chooses to not kill Galen.
0090_00.02.21.115-00.02.23.035	Rebel bombers attack the facility
0090_00.02.23.035-00.02.25.745	and Galen dies in his daugher's arms
0090_00.02.25.745-00.02.27.300	before she escapes with the group.
0090_00.02.27.300-00.02.32.295	Krennic is summoned by Darth Vader to answer for the attack on Eadu.
0090_00.02.32.295-00.02.34.405	Krennic seeks Vader's support for an audience with the Emperor,
0090_00.02.34.405-00.02.39.045	but Vader instead orders him to ensure that no further breaches occur.
0090_00.02.39.045-00.02.43.805	Jyn proposes a plan to steal the Death Star's schematics using the Rebel fleet, 
0090_00.02.43.805-00.02.49.570	but fails to get approval from the Alliance Council, who feel victory against the Empire is now impossible.
0090_00.02.49.570-00.02.55.330	Frustrated with their inaction,
0090_00.02.55.330-00.02.57.950	Jyn's group lead a small squad of Rebel volunteers to raid the data banks themselves.
0090_00.02.57.950-00.03.02.910	Arriving at Scarif on the stolen Imperial ship, dubbed Rogue One,
0090_00.03.02.910-00.03.06.480	Jyn and Cassian enter the base with K-2SO, 
0090_00.03.06.480-00.03.11.300	while the other Rebels attack the resident Imperial garrison as a distraction.
0090_00.03.11.300-00.03.15.120	The Rebel fleet learns about the raid from an intercepted communication
0090_00.03.15.120-00.03.16.390	and they deploy support.
0090_00.03.16.405-00.03.17.825	K-2SO sacrifices himself
0090_00.03.17.825-00.03.21.205	so Jyn and Cassian can retrieve the data.
0090_00.03.21.210-00.03.22.990	Chirrut is killed
0090_00.03.22.990-00.03.24.370	after activating the master switch
0090_00.03.24.370-00.03.26.790	 to allow communications with the Rebel fleet, 
0090_00.03.26.800-00.03.29.160	and Malbus dies shortly afterwards.
0090_00.03.29.160-00.03.32.290	Rook is also killed by a grenade
0090_00.03.32.290-00.03.33.950	after informing the Rebel fleet 
0090_00.03.33.950-00.03.35.910	that it must deacativate the shield surrounding the planet
0090_00.03.35.910-00.03.37.860	in order to allow the transmission of the schematic.
0090_00.03.37.865-00.03.40.805	Jyn and Cassian obtain the schematics,
0090_00.03.40.805-00.03.42.605	but they are ambushed by Krennic
0090_00.03.42.605-00.03.44.915	who is eventually shot by Cassian.
0090_00.03.44.915-00.03.48.305	Jyn transmits the schematics to the Rebel command ship,
0090_00.03.48.305-00.03.50.325	however, the Death Star enters the orbit above Scarif, 
0090_00.03.50.325-00.03.53.850	where Tarkin uses another low-powered shot 
0090_00.03.53.850-00.03.55.700	to destroy the compromised base,
0090_00.03.55.705-00.03.58.320	killing Krennic, Cassian and Jyn.
0090_00.03.58.320-00.04.01.090	The Rebel fleet prepares for jump into hyperspace, 
0090_00.04.01.090-00.04.04.030	but many of the fleet ships are intercepted by Vader's flagship.
0090_00.04.04.030-00.04.10.950	Vader boards the Rebel command ship and attempts to regain the schematics, killing many,
0090_00.04.10.950-00.04.14.040	but a small starship escapes with the schematics on board.
0090_00.04.14.040-00.04.15.610	Aboard the fleeing ship,
0090_00.04.15.610-00.04.19.120	Princess Leia declares that the schematics will provide hope for the rebellion,
0090_00.04.19.120-00.04.23.120	leading directly into Episode Four, a New Hope.
0091_00.00.17.450-00.00.18.580	Three teenagers,
0091_00.00.18.580-00.00.19.580	Claire,
0091_00.00.19.580-00.00.20.440	Marcia
0091_00.00.20.440-00.00.21.120	and Casey
0091_00.00.21.120-00.00.24.480	are kidnapped and held captive by Dennis,
0091_00.00.24.480-00.00.28.240	one of 23 personalities present in the mind of Kevin Wendell Crumb,
0091_00.00.28.240-00.00.30.870	a victim of childhood abuse
0091_00.00.30.870-00.00.34.740	and diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder or multiple personalities.
0091_00.00.34.745-00.00.38.105	Kevin has been treated by Dr. Karen Fletcher
0091_00.00.38.105-00.00.40.230	and appears to be stable.
0091_00.00.40.230-00.00.46.910	Within his mind, all of his personalities are controlled by the personality Barry, and wait for their turn to control the body.
0091_00.00.46.915-00.00.50.485	Two personalities, however, Dennis and Patricia, 
0091_00.00.50.485-00.00.53.325	are kept out because of their destructive behavior
0091_00.00.53.325-00.00.57.945	and their worshipping of the Beast, a rumored twenty fourth personality.
0091_00.00.57.945-00.01.00.775	The three girls realize Kevin's nature
0091_00.01.00.775-00.01.01.980	when they meet Patricia.
0091_00.01.01.980-00.01.03.910	Casey seeks to befriend Hedwig,
0091_00.01.03.910-00.01.05.540	a personality that claims to be a nine-year-old boy,
0091_00.01.05.540-00.01.09.120	who confides in the girls
0091_00.01.09.120-00.01.11.630	that they will be sacrificed to the Beast. 
0091_00.01.11.640-00.01.15.370	He says that he stole control from Barry
0091_00.01.15.370-00.01.16.990	and was persuaded to help Dennis and Patricia.
0091_00.01.16.995-00.01.18.825	When Claire attempts to escape,
0091_00.01.18.825-00.01.21.280	Dennis locks her in a separate cell.
0091_00.01.21.280-00.01.26.700	Dennis attempts to masquerade as Barry when in a meeting with Dr. Fletcher, 
0091_00.01.26.700-00.01.30.440	but she realizes that Dennis and Patricia have taken over as the dominant personalities.
0091_00.01.30.445-00.01.32.245	Marcia tries to escape next,
0091_00.01.32.245-00.01.35.875	but is caught and also is placed into a different cell.
0091_00.01.35.880-00.01.40.860	Casey continues to try to befriend Hedwig, having heard him mention a window in his bedroom.
0091_00.01.40.860-00.01.44.400	Casey persuades him to take her there,
0091_00.01.44.400-00.01.46.910	but learns that the window is only a drawing.
0091_00.01.46.910-00.01.49.790	Hedwig reveals a walkie talkie,
0091_00.01.49.790-00.01.54.190	but Casey is subdued by Patricia as she attempts to use the radio for help.
0091_00.01.54.190-00.01.58.910	Casey experiences a flashback to being molested as a child by her Uncle John, 
0091_00.01.58.910-00.02.01.950	who became her legal guardian after her father's death.
0091_00.02.01.955-00.02.06.825	Dr. Fletcher begins to suspect that Dennis is responsible for the kidnappings
0091_00.02.06.825-00.02.08.740	and makes a visit to where he lives.
0091_00.02.08.740-00.02.10.040	She discovers Claire,
0091_00.02.10.040-00.02.11.160	but she is caught,
0091_00.02.11.160-00.02.13.210	 drugged and locked up by Dennis.
0091_00.02.13.210-00.02.15.290	He then turns into the Beast, 
0091_00.02.15.290-00.02.19.140	manifesting superhuman speed, strength and agility.
0091_00.02.19.145-00.02.24.665	Knowing the only way to call for the real Kevin is to speak his full name, Dr. Fletcher writes it on a piece of paper
0091_00.02.24.665-00.02.26.730	before being killed.
0091_00.02.26.730-00.02.30.360	The Beast then kills and eats both Marcia and Claire.
0091_00.02.30.365-00.02.33.705	Casey stumbles upon Dr. Fletcher's corpse
0091_00.02.33.705-00.02.34.870	and reads her note.
0091_00.02.34.870-00.02.37.370	She briefly calls to Kevin by speaking his name.
0091_00.02.37.375-00.02.41.325	Horrified, Kevin orders Casey to kill him,
0091_00.02.41.325-00.02.43.585	 however, the Beast returns
0091_00.02.43.585-00.02.46.200	and Casey shoots him, but only injures him.
0091_00.02.46.200-00.02.54.370	The Beast then voices his plan to rid the world of the untouched, those whose hearts are impure because they have never suffered in their lives.
0091_00.02.54.375-00.02.56.705	The Beast chases Casey into a cage
0091_00.02.56.705-00.02.59.120	and then notices her scars.
0091_00.02.59.120-00.03.03.860	The Beast spares Casey's life because she is pure and leaves.
0091_00.03.03.860-00.03.06.080	Casey is rescued
0091_00.03.06.080-00.03.09.620	and learns that she is being held under the Philadelphia Zoo, where Kevin worked and lived.
0091_00.03.09.620-00.03.13.820	Casey is asked if she is ready to return home with her uncle.
0091_00.03.13.820-00.03.15.200	In another hideout, 
0091_00.03.15.200-00.03.23.700	Dennis, Patricia and Hedwig exert collective control over Kevin's body and admire the power of the Beast and their plans to change the world.
0091_00.03.23.710-00.03.29.530	We later see in a diner patrons listening to media coverage of Kevin's crimes, 
0091_00.03.29.530-00.03.31.440	for which he has been nicknamed "The Horde."
0091_00.03.31.440-00.03.34.400	One of the patrons notes the similarities between Kevin
0091_00.03.34.400-00.03.38.700	and a terrorist who used a wheelchair and was arrested 15 years prior.
0091_00.03.38.700-00.03.42.230	The man sitting next to her, David Dunne, 
0091_00.03.42.230-00.03.49.240	reminds the patron that the terrorist's name was Mr. Glass, a reference to another M. Night Shamalan movie, Unbreakable,
0091_00.03.49.240-00.03.52.320	indicating that both of these take place in the same universe.
0092_00.00.17.165-00.00.18.875	The film takes place in Georgetown, 
0092_00.00.18.875-00.00.21.995	where actress Chris MacNeil is working
0092_00.00.21.995-00.00.23.950	and living with her 12 year old daughter, Regan.
0092_00.00.23.965-00.00.26.025	Chris has just finished the final scene of her film
0092_00.00.26.025-00.00.28.700	with her associate, Burke Dennings.
0092_00.00.28.700-00.00.30.940	After playing with a Ouji board,
0092_00.00.30.940-00.00.35.020	Regan begins to act strangely, stealing and becoming violent.
0092_00.00.35.035-00.00.36.565	At a party that her mother hosts, 
0092_00.00.36.565-00.00.40.245	Regan tells an astronuat that he is going to "die up there," 
0092_00.00.40.245-00.00.43.580	and begins urinating on the floor.
0092_00.00.43.580-00.00.48.080	She later begins to shake violently in her bed in a very unnatural way.
0092_00.00.48.085-00.00.50.075	Chris meets with several doctors, 
0092_00.00.50.075-00.00.52.815	but they cannot find anything physically wrong with her daughter.
0092_00.00.52.815-00.00.54.925	One night when Burke Dennings is babysitting,
0092_00.00.54.925-00.00.58.315	Chris returns home
0092_00.00.58.315-00.00.59.405	to find that Burke has died from falling out of Regan's window 
0092_00.00.59.405-00.01.03.650	and falling down to the outside stairs.
0092_00.01.03.650-00.01.05.620	Burke's death is investigated by Lieutenant William Kinderman. 
0092_00.01.05.620-00.01.12.490	He also interviews a priest and psychiatrist, Father Damien Karras, whose mother just recently died.
0092_00.01.12.490-00.01.18.020	Thinking that Regan's condition is psychiatric, doctors recomment that she have an exorcism.
0092_00.01.18.025-00.01.20.105	Chris meets with Father Karras,
0092_00.01.20.105-00.01.24.405	and after recording Regan speaking backwards and in languages that she couldn't know, 
0092_00.01.24.405-00.01.27.035	along with having the words "help me" appearing on her stomach,
0092_00.01.27.035-00.01.31.375	Father Karras is convinced that she is actually possessed.
0092_00.01.31.375-00.01.33.905	Another priest is brought in to lead the exorcism,
0092_00.01.33.905-00.01.36.545	Father Merrin, who has spent some time in Iraq,
0092_00.01.36.545-00.01.40.815	and first encountered the demon, Pazuzu,
0092_00.01.40.815-00.01.41.795	the same demon who is now possessing Regan.
0092_00.01.41.800-00.01.46.250	Both priests witness the possessed Regan's violent and vulgar actions, 
0092_00.01.46.250-00.01.51.090	and the stubborn Pazuzu resists the exorcism and continues to toy with them, 
0092_00.01.51.090-00.01.56.070	especially with Father Karras, oftentimes mocking him with the voice of his head mother.
0092_00.01.56.085-00.02.00.735	Father Merrin dismisses Karras as he is showing weakness
0092_00.02.00.735-00.02.01.590	and attempts the exorcism alone.
0092_00.02.01.590-00.02.05.580	When Karras returns, however, he finds that Merrin is dead.
0092_00.02.05.585-00.02.07.695	Karras attacks the laughing Pazuzu
0092_00.02.07.695-00.02.10.050	and Father Karras demands that Pazuzu possess him.
0092_00.02.10.065-00.02.12.965	Once Pazuzu enters Father Karras,
0092_00.02.12.975-00.02.15.955	he throws himself from the window,
0092_00.02.15.955-00.02.17.315	mortally injuring himself
0092_00.02.17.315-00.02.20.040	and the sacrifice leaves Regan unpossessed.
0092_00.02.20.040-00.02.25.790	As Karras is dying, a friend, Father Dyer, administers his last rites.
0092_00.02.25.790-00.02.30.070	A few days later, we see Regan back to normal, leaving for Los Angeles with her mother.

0093_00.01.24.290-00.01.24.940	Separating from the group,
0093_00.01.24.940-00.01.27.480	Jane is teleported to another world,
